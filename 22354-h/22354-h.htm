CHAPTER I</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">FIRST FLIGHT</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">The</span>
elderly lady-bee who helped the baby-bee Maya when she awoke to life and
slipped from her cell was called Cassandra and commanded great respect
in the hive. Those were exciting days. A&nbsp;rebellion had broken out
in the nation of bees, which the queen was unable to suppress.</p>

<p>While the experienced Cassandra wiped Maya’s large bright eyes and
tried as best she could to arrange her delicate wings, the big hive
hummed and buzzed like a threatening thunderstorm, and the baby-bee
found it very warm and said so to her companion.</p>

<p>Cassandra looked about troubled, without
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
replying. It astonished her that the child so soon found something to
criticize. But really the child was right: the heat and the pushing and
crowding were almost unbearable. Maya saw an endless succession of bees
go by in such swarming haste that sometimes one climbed up and over
another, or several rolled past together clotted in a ball.</p>

<p>Once the queen-bee approached. Cassandra and Maya were jostled aside.
A&nbsp;drone, a&nbsp;friendly young fellow of immaculate appearance,
came to their assistance. He nodded to Maya and stroked the shining
hairs on his breast rather nervously with his foreleg. (The bees use
their forelegs as arms and hands.)</p>

<p>“The crash will come,” he said to Cassandra. “The revolutionists will
leave the city. A&nbsp;new queen has already been proclaimed.”</p>

<p>Cassandra scarcely noticed him. She did not even thank him for his
help, and Maya felt keenly conscious that the old lady was not a bit
nice to the young gentleman. The child was a little afraid to ask
questions, the impressions were coming so thick and fast; they
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
threatened to overwhelm her. The general excitement got into her blood,
and she set up a fine, distinct buzzing.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” said Cassandra. “Isn’t there noise enough
as it&nbsp;is?”</p>

<p>Maya subsided at once, and looked at Cassandra questioningly.</p>

<p>“Come here, child, we’ll see if we cannot quiet down a bit.”
Cassandra took Maya by her gleaming wings, which were still soft and new
and marvelously transparent, and shoved her into an almost deserted
corner beside a few honeycombs filled with honey.</p>

<p>Maya stood still and held on to one of the cells.</p>

<p>“It smells delicious here,” she observed.</p>

<p>Her remark seemed to fluster the old lady again.</p>

<p>“You must learn to wait, child,” she replied. “I have brought up
several hundred young bees this spring and given them lessons for their
first flight, but I haven’t come across another one that was as pert and
forward as you are. You seem to be an exceptional nature.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<p>Maya blushed and stuck the two dainty fingers of her hand in her
mouth.</p>

<p>“Exceptional nature&mdash;what is an exceptional nature?” she asked
shyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>that’s</i> not nice,” cried Cassandra, referring not to
Maya’s question, which she had scarcely heeded, but to the child’s
sticking her fingers in her mouth. “Now, listen. Listen very carefully
to what I am going to tell you. I&nbsp;can devote only a short time to
you. Other baby-bees have already slipped out, and the only helper I
have on this floor is Turka, and Turka is dreadfully overworked and for
the last few days has been complaining of a buzzing in her ears. Sit
down here.”</p>

<p>Maya obeyed, with great brown eyes fastened on her teacher.</p>

<p>“The first rule that a young bee must learn,” said Cassandra, and
sighed, “is that every bee, in whatever it thinks and does, must be like
the other bees and must always have the good of all in mind. In our
order of society, which we have held to be the right one from time
immemorial and which couldn’t have been better preserved than it has
been, this rule is
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
the one fundamental basis for the well-being of the state. To-morrow you
will fly out of the hive, an older bee will accompany you. At first you
will be allowed to fly only short stretches and you will have to observe
everything, very carefully, so that you can find your way back home
again. Your companion will show you the hundred flowers and blossoms
that yield the best nectar. You’ll have to learn them by heart. This is
something no bee can escape doing.&mdash;Here, you may as well learn the
first line right away&mdash;clover and honeysuckle. Repeat it. Say
‘clover and honeysuckle.’”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said little Maya. “It’s awfully hard. I’ll see the flowers
later anyway.”</p>

<p>Cassandra opened her old eyes wide and shook her head.</p>

<p>“You’ll come to a bad end,” she sighed. “I can foresee that
already.”</p>

<p>“Am I supposed later on to gather nectar all day long?” asked
Maya.</p>

<p>Cassandra fetched a deep sigh and gazed at the baby-bee seriously and
sadly. She seemed to be thinking of her own toilsome
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
life&mdash;toil from beginning to end, nothing but toil. Then she spoke
in a changed voice, with a loving look in her eyes for the child.</p>

<p>“My dear little Maya, there will be other things in your
life&mdash;the sunshine, lofty green trees, flowery heaths, lakes of
silver, rushing, glistening waterways, the heavens blue and radiant, and
perhaps even human beings, the highest and most perfect of Nature’s
creations. Because of all these glories your work will become a joy.
Just think&mdash;all that lies ahead of you, dear heart. You have good
reason to be happy.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” said Maya, “that’s what I want to be.”</p>

<p>Cassandra smiled kindly. In that instant&mdash;why, she did not
know&mdash;she conceived a peculiar affection for the little bee, such
as she could not recall ever having felt for any child-bee before. And
that, probably, is how it came about that she told Maya more than a bee
usually hears on the first day of its life. She gave her various special
bits of advice, warned her against the dangers of the wicked
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
world, and named the bees’ most dangerous enemies. At the end she spoke
long of human beings, and implanted the first love for them in the
child’s heart and the germ of a great longing to know them.</p>

<p>“Be polite and agreeable to every insect you meet,” she said in
conclusion, “then you will learn more from them than I have told you
to-day. But beware of the wasps and hornets. The hornets are our most
formidable enemy, and the wickedest, and the wasps are a useless tribe
of thieves, without home or religion. We are a stronger, more powerful
nation, while they steal and murder wherever they can. You may use your
sting upon insects, to defend yourself and inspire respect, but if you
insert it in a warm-blooded animal, especially a human being, you will
die, because it will remain sticking in the skin and will break off. So
do not sting warm-blooded creatures except in dire need, and then do it
without flinching or fear of death. For it is to our courage as well as
our wisdom that we bees owe the universal respect and esteem in which we
are held. And now good-by, Maya
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
dear. Good luck to you. Be faithful to your people and your queen.”</p>

<p>The little bee nodded yes, and returned her old monitor’s kiss and
embrace. She went to bed in a flutter of secret joy and excitement and
could scarcely fall asleep from curiosity. For the next day she was to
know the great, wide world, the sun, the sky and the flowers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bee-city had quieted down. A large part of the younger
bees had now left the kingdom to found a new city; but for a long time
the droning of the great swarm could be heard outside in the sunlight.
It was not from arrogance or evil intent against the queen that these
had quitted; it was because the population had grown to such a size that
there was no longer room for all the inhabitants, and it was impossible
to store a sufficient food-supply of honey to feed them all over the
winter. You see, according to a government treaty of long standing,
a&nbsp;large part of the honey gathered in summer had to be delivered up
to human beings, who in return assured the welfare of the bee-state,
provided
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
for the peace and safety of the bees, and gave them shelter against the
cold in winter.</p>

<p>“The sun has risen!”</p>

<p>The joyous call sounding in Maya’s ears awoke her out of sleep the
next morning. She jumped up and joined a lady working-bee.</p>

<p>“Delighted,” said the lady cordially. “You may fly with me.”</p>

<p>At the gate, where there was a great pushing and crowding, they were
held up by the sentinels, one of whom gave Maya the password without
which no bee was admitted into the city.</p>

<p>“Be sure to remember it,” he said, “and good luck to you.”</p>

<p>Outside the city gates, a flood of sunlight assailed the little bee,
a&nbsp;brilliance of green and gold, so rich and warm and resplendent
that she had to close her eyes, not knowing what to say or do from sheer
delight.</p>

<p>“Magnificent! It really is,” she said to her companion. “Do we fly
into that?”</p>

<p>“Right ahead!” answered the lady-bee.</p>

<p>Maya raised her little head and moved her pretty new wings. Suddenly
she felt the
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
flying-board on which she had been sitting sink down, while the ground
seemed to be gliding away behind, and the large green domes of the
tree-tops seemed to be coming toward her.</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled, her heart rejoiced.</p>

<p>“I am flying,” she cried. “It cannot be anything else. What I am
doing must be flying. Why, it’s splendid, perfectly splendid!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re flying,” said the lady-bee, who had difficulty in
keeping up with the child. “Those are linden-trees, those toward which
we are flying, the lindens in our castle park. You can always tell where
our city is by those lindens. But you’re flying so fast, Maya.”</p>

<p>“Fast?” said Maya. “How can one fly fast enough? Oh, how sweet the
sunshine smells!”</p>

<p>“No,” replied her companion, who was rather out of breath, “it’s not
the sunshine, it’s the flowers that smell.&mdash;But please, don’t go so
fast, else I’ll drop behind. Besides, at this pace you won’t observe
things and be able to find your way back.”</p>

<p>But little Maya transported by the sunshine and the joy of living,
did not hear.
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
She felt as though she were darting like an arrow through a
green-shimmering sea of light, to greater and greater splendor. The
bright flowers seemed to call to her, the still, sunlit distances lured
her on, and the blue sky blessed her joyous young flight.</p>

<p>“Never again will it be as beautiful as it is to-day,” she thought.
“I <i>can’t</i> turn back. I&nbsp;can’t think of anything except the
sun.”</p>

<p>Beneath her the gay pictures kept changing, the peaceful landscape
slid by slowly, in broad stretches.</p>

<p>“The sun must be all of gold,” thought the baby-bee.</p>

<p>Coming to a large garden, which seemed to rest in blossoming clouds
of cherry-tree, hawthorn, and lilacs, she let herself down to earth,
dead-tired, and dropped in a bed of red tulips, where she held on to one
of the big flowers. With a great sigh of bliss she pressed herself
against the blossom-wall and looked up to the deep blue of the sky
through the gleaming edges of the flowers.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic013.png" width = "251" height = "164"

</p>

<p>“Oh, how beautiful it is out here in the great world, a thousand
times more beautiful than
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
in the dark hive. I’ll never go back there again to carry honey or make
wax. No, indeed, I’ll never do that. I&nbsp;want to see and know the
world in bloom. I&nbsp;am not like the other bees, my heart is meant for
pleasure and surprises, experiences and adventures. I&nbsp;will not be
afraid of any dangers. Haven’t I got strength and courage and a
sting?”</p>

<p>She laughed, bubbling over with delight, and took a deep draught of
nectar out of the flower of the tulip.</p>

<p>“Grand,” she thought. “It’s glorious to be alive.”</p>

<p>Ah, if little Maya had had an inkling of the many dangers and
hardships that lay ahead of her, she would certainly have thought twice.
But never dreaming of such things, she stuck to her resolve.</p>

<p>Soon tiredness overcame her, and she fell asleep. When she awoke, the
sun was gone, twilight lay upon the land. A&nbsp;bit of alarm, after
all. Maya’s heart went a little faster. Hesitatingly she crept out of
the flower, which was about to close up for the night, and hid herself
away under a leaf high up in the top
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
of an old tree, where she went to sleep, thinking in the utmost
confidence:</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid. I won’t be afraid right at the very start. The sun
is coming round again; that’s certain; Cassandra said so. The thing to
do is to go to sleep quietly and sleep well.”</p>

CHAPTER II</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE HOUSE OF THE ROSE</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">By</span>
the time Maya awoke, it was full daylight. She felt a little chilly
under her big green leaf, and stiff in her limbs, so that her first
movements were slow and clumsy. Clinging to a vein of the leaf she let
her wings quiver and vibrate, to limber them up and shake off the dust;
then she smoothed her fair hair, wiped her large eyes clean, and crept,
warily, down to the edge of the leaf, where she paused and looked
around.</p>

<p>The glory and the glow of the morning sun were dazzling. Though
Maya’s resting-place still lay in cool shadow, the leaves overhead shone
like green gold.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<p>“Oh, you glorious world,” thought the little bee.</p>

<p>Slowly, one by one, the experiences of the previous day came back to
her&mdash;all the beauties she had seen and all the risks she had run.
She remained firm in her resolve not to return to the hive. To be sure,
when she thought of Cassandra, her heart beat fast, though it was not
very likely that Cassandra would ever find her.&mdash;No, no, to her
there was no joy in forever having to fly in and out of the hive,
carrying honey and making wax. This was clear, once and for all. She
wanted to be happy and free and enjoy life in her own way. Come what
might, she would take the consequences.</p>

<p>Thus lightly thought Maya, the truth being that she had no real idea
of the things that lay in store for her.</p>

<p>Afar off in the sunshine something glimmered red. A lurking
impatience seized the little bee. Moreover, she felt hungry. So,
courageously, with a loud joyous buzz, she swung out of her hiding-place
into the clear, glistening air and the warm sunlight, and
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
made straight for the red patch that seemed to nod and beckon. When she
drew near she smelled a perfume so sweet that it almost robbed her of
her senses, and she was hardly able to reach the large red flower. She
let herself down on the outermost of its curved petals and clung to it
tightly. At the gentle tipping of the petal a shining silver sphere
almost as big as herself, came rolling toward her, transparent and
gleaming in all the colors of the rainbow. Maya was dreadfully
frightened, yet fascinated too by the splendor of the cool silver
sphere, which rolled by her, balanced on the edge of the petal, leapt
into the sunshine, and fell down in the grass. Oh, oh! The beautiful
ball had shivered into a score of wee pearls. Maya uttered a little cry
of terror. But the tiny round fragments made such a bright, lively
glitter in the grass, and ran down the blades in such twinkling,
sparkling little drops like diamonds in the lamplight, that she was
reassured.</p>

<p>She turned towards the inside of the calix. A beetle, a little
smaller than herself, with brown wing-sheaths and a black breastplate,
was sitting
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
at the entrance. He kept his place unperturbed, and looked at her
seriously, though by no means unamiably. Maya bowed politely.</p>

<p>“Did the ball belong to you?” she asked, and receiving no reply
added: “I am very sorry I threw it down.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the dewdrop?” smiled the beetle, rather superior. “You
needn’t worry about that. I&nbsp;had taken a drink already and my wife
never drinks water, she has kidney trouble.&mdash;What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>“What is this wonderful flower?” asked Maya, not answering the
beetle’s question. “Would you be good enough to tell me its name?”</p>

<p>Remembering Cassandra’s advice she was as polite as possible.</p>

<p>The beetle moved his shiny head in his dorsal plate, a thing he could
do easily without the least discomfort, as his head fitted in perfectly
and glided back and forth without a click.</p>

<p>“You seem to be only of yesterday?” he said, and laughed&mdash;not so
very politely. Altogether there was something about him
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
that struck Maya as unrefined. The bees had more culture and better
manners. Yet he seemed to be a good-natured fellow, because, seeing
Maya’s blush of embarrassment, he softened to her childish
ignorance.</p>

<p>“It’s a rose,” he explained indulgently. “So now you know.&mdash;We
moved in four days ago, and since we moved in, it has flourished
wonderfully under our care.&mdash;Won’t you come&nbsp;in?”</p>

<p>Maya hesitated, then conquered her misgivings and took a few steps
forward. He pressed aside a bright petal, Maya entered, and she and the
beetle walked beside each other through the narrow chambers with their
subdued light and fragrant walls.</p>

<p>“What a charming home!” exclaimed Maya, genuinely taken with the
place. “The perfume is positively intoxicating.”</p>

<p>Maya’s admiration pleased the beetle.</p>

<p>“It takes wisdom to know where to live,” he said, and smiled
good-naturedly. “‘Tell me where you live and I’ll tell you what you’re
worth,’ says an old adage.&mdash;Would you like some nectar?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<p>“Oh,” Maya burst out, “I’d love some.”</p>

<p>The beetle nodded and disappeared behind one of the walls. Maya
looked about. She was happy. She pressed her cheeks and little hands
against the dainty red hangings and took deep breaths of the delicious
perfume, in an ecstasy of delight at being permitted to stop in such a
beautiful dwelling.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a great joy to be alive,” she thought. “And there’s
no comparison between the dingy, crowded stories in which the bees live
and work and this house. The very quiet here is splendid.”</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud sound of scolding behind the walls. It was
the beetle growling excitedly in great anger. He seemed to be hustling
and pushing someone along roughly, and Maya caught the following, in a
clear, piping voice full of fright and mortification.</p>

<p>“Of course, because I’m alone, you dare to lay hands on me. But wait
and see what you get when I bring my associates along. You are a
ruffian. Very well, I&nbsp;am going. But remember, I&nbsp;called you a
ruffian. You’ll never forget <i>that</i>.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<p>The stranger’s emphatic tone, so sharp and vicious, frightened Maya
dreadfully. In a few moments she heard the sound of someone running
out.</p>

<p>The beetle returned and sullenly flung down some nectar.</p>

<p>“An outrage,” he said. “You can’t escape those vermin anywhere. They
don’t allow you a moment’s peace.”</p>

<p>Maya was so hungry she forgot to thank him and took a mouthful of
nectar and chewed, while the beetle wiped the perspiration from his
forehead and slightly loosened his upper armor so as to catch his
breath.</p>

<p>“Who was that?” mumbled Maya, with her mouth still full.</p>

<p>“Please empty your mouth&mdash;finish chewing and swallowing your
nectar. One can’t understand a word you say.”</p>

<p>Maya obeyed, but the excited owner of the house gave her no time to
repeat her question.</p>

<p>“It was an ant,” he burst out angrily. “Do those ants think we save
and store up hour after hour only for them! The idea of going right into
the pantry without a how-do-you-do
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
or a by-your-leave! It makes me furious. If I didn’t realize that the
ill-mannered creatures actually didn’t know better, I&nbsp;wouldn’t
hesitate a second to call them&mdash;thieves!”</p>

<p class = "illustration">

alt = "Maya flies away from Peter">
</p>

<p>At this he suddenly remembered his own manners.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, turning to Maya, “I forgot to introduce
myself. My name is Peter, of the family of rose-beetles.”</p>

<p>“My name is Maya,” said the little bee shyly. “I am delighted to make
your acquaintance.” She looked at Peter closely; he was bowing
repeatedly, and spreading his feelers like two little brown fans. That
pleased Maya immensely.</p>

<p>“You have the most fascinating feelers,” she said, “simply
sweet....”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” observed Peter, flattered, “people do think a lot of
them. Would you like to see the other side?”</p>

<p>“If I may.”</p>

<p>The rose-beetle turned his fan-shaped feelers to one side and let a
ray of sunlight glide over them.</p>

<p>“Great, don’t you think?” he asked.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<p>“I shouldn’t have thought anything like them possible,” rejoined
Maya. “My own feelers are very plain.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” observed Peter, “to each his own. By way of compensation
you certainly have beautiful eyes, and the color of your body, the gold
of your body, is not to be sneezed&nbsp;at.”</p>

<p>Maya beamed. Peter was the first person to tell her she had any good
looks. Life was great. She was happy as a lark, and helped herself to
some more nectar.</p>

<p>“An excellent quality of honey,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“Take some more,” said Peter, rather amazed by his little guest’s
appetite. “Rose-juice of the first vintage. One has to be careful and
not spoil one’s stomach. There’s some dew left, too, if you’re
thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” said Maya. “I’d like to fly now, if you will
permit&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>The rose-beetle laughed.</p>

<p>“Flying, always flying,” he said. “It’s in the blood of you bees.
I&nbsp;don’t understand such a restless way of living. There’s some
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
advantage in staying in one place, too, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>Peter courteously held the red curtain aside.</p>

<p>“I’ll go as far as our observation petal with you,” he said. “It
makes an excellent place to fly from.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” said Maya, “I can fly from anywhere.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you have the advantage over me,” replied Peter. “I have
some difficulty in unfolding my lower wings.” He shook her hand and held
the last curtain aside for her.</p>

<p>“Oh, the blue sky!” rejoiced Maya. “Good-by.”</p>

<p>“So long,” called Peter, remaining on the top petal to see Maya rise
rapidly straight up to the sky in the golden sunlight and the clear,
pure air of the morning. With a sigh he returned, pensive, to his cool
rose-dwelling, for though it was still early he was feeling rather warm.
He sang his morning song to himself, and it hummed in the red sheen of
the petals and the radiance of the spring day that slowly mounted and
spread over the blossoming earth.</p>

CHAPTER III</a></h5>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">“Dear</span>
me,” thought Maya, after she had flown off, “oh, dear me, I forgot to
ask Mr. Peter about human beings. A&nbsp;gentleman of his wide
experience could certainly have told me about them. But perhaps I’ll
meet one myself to-day.” Full of high spirits and in a happy mood of
adventure, she let her bright eyes rove over the wide landscape that lay
spread out below in all its summer splendor.</p>

<p>She came to a large garden gleaming with a thousand colors. On her
way she met many insects, who sang out greetings, and wished her a
pleasant journey and a good harvest.&mdash;But
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
every time she met a bee, her heart went pit-a-pat. After all she felt a
little guilty to be idle, and was afraid of coming upon acquaintances.
Soon, however, she saw that the bees paid not the slightest attention to
her.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden the world seemed to turn upside down. The
heavens shone <i>below</i> her, in endless depths. At first she was
dreadfully frightened; she thought she had flown too far up and lost her
way in the sky. But presently she noticed that the trees were mirrored
on the edge of the terrestrial sky, and to her entrancement she realized
that she was looking at a great serene basin of water which lay blue and
clear in the peaceful morning. She let herself down close to the
surface. There was her image flying in reflection, the lovely gold of
her body shining at her from the water, her bright wings glittering like
clear glass. And she observed that she held her little legs properly
against her body, as Cassandra had taught her to&nbsp;do.</p>

<p>“It’s bliss to be flying over the surface of water like this. It is,
really,” she thought.</p>

<p>Big fish and little fish swam about in the
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
clear element, or seemed to float idly. Maya took good care not to go
too close; she knew there was danger to bees from the race of
fishes.</p>

<p>On the opposite shore she was attracted by the water-lilies and the
rushes, the water-lilies with their large round leaves lying outspread
on the water like green plates, and the rushes with their sun-warmed,
reedy stalks.</p>

<p>She picked out a leaf well-concealed under the tall blades of the
rushes. It lay in almost total shade, except for two round spots like
gold coins; the rushes swayed above in the full sunlight.</p>

<p>“Glorious,” said the little bee, “perfectly glorious.”</p>

<p>She began to tidy herself. Putting both arms up behind her head she
pulled it forward as if to tear it off, but was careful not to pull too
hard, just enough to scrape away the dust; then, with her little hind
legs, she stroked and dragged down her wing-sheaths, which sprang back
in position looking beautifully bright and glossy.</p>

<p>Just as she had completed her toilet a small
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
steely blue-bottle came and alighted on the leaf beside her. He looked
at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here on my leaf?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Maya was startled.</p>

<p>“Is there any objection to a person’s just resting here a moment or
two?”</p>

<p>Maya remembered Cassandra’s telling her that the nation of bees
commanded great respect in the insect world. Now she was going to see if
it was true; she was going to see if she, Maya, could compel respect.
Nevertheless her heart beat a little faster because her tone had been
very loud and peremptory.</p>

<p>But actually the blue-bottle was frightened. He showed it plainly.
When he saw that Maya wasn’t going to let anyone lay down the law to her
he backed down. With a surly buzz he swung himself on to a blade that
curved above Maya’s leaf, and said in a much politer tone, talking down
to her out of the sunshine:</p>

<p>“You ought to be working. As a bee you certainly ought. But if you
want to rest, all right. I’ll wait here.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<p>“There are plenty of leaves,” observed Maya.</p>

<p>“All rented,” said the blue-bottle. “Now-a-days one is happy to be
able to call a piece of ground one’s own. If my predecessor hadn’t been
snapped up by a frog two days ago, I&nbsp;should still be without a
proper place to live in. It’s not very pleasant to have to hunt up a
different lodging every night. Not everyone has such a well-ordered
state as you bees. But permit me to introduce myself. My name is Jack
Christopher.”</p>

<p>Maya was silent with terror, thinking how awful it must be to fall
into the clutches of a frog.</p>

<p>“Are there many frogs in the lake?” she asked and drew to the very
middle of the leaf so as not to be seen from the water.</p>

<p>The blue-bottle laughed.</p>

<p>“You are giving yourself unnecessary trouble,” he jeered. “The frog
can see you from below when the sun shines, because then the leaf is
transparent. He sees you sitting on my leaf, perfectly.”</p>

<p>Beset by the awful idea that maybe a big
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
frog was squatting right under her leaf staring at her with his bulging
hungry eyes, Maya was about to fly off when something dreadful happened,
something for which she was totally unprepared. In the confusion of the
first moment she could not make out just exactly what <i>was</i>
happening. She only heard a loud rustling like the wind in dry leaves,
then a singing whistle, a&nbsp;loud angry hunter’s cry. And a fine,
transparent shadow glided over her leaf. Now she saw&mdash;saw fully,
and her heart stood still in terror. A&nbsp;great, glittering dragon-fly
had caught hold of poor Jack Christopher and held him tight in its
large, fangs, sharp as a knife. The blade of the rush bent low beneath
their weight. Maya could see them hovering above her and also mirrored
in the clear water below. Jack’s screams tore her heart. Without
thinking, she cried:</p>

<p>“Let the blue-bottle go, at once, whoever you are. You have no right
to interfere with people’s habits. You have no right to be so
arbitrary.”</p>

<p>The dragon-fly released Jack from its fangs,
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
but still held him fast with its arms, and turned its head toward Maya.
She was fearfully frightened by its large, grave eyes and vicious
pincers, but the glittering of its body and wings fascinated her. They
flashed like glass and water and precious stones. The horrifying thing
was its huge size. How could she have been so bold? She was all
a-tremble.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, child?” The dragon-fly’s tone, surprisingly,
was quite friendly.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” cried Maya, and tears came into her eyes. “His name is
Jack Christopher.”</p>

<p>The dragon-fly smiled.</p>

<p>“Why, little one?” it said, putting on an interested air, though most
condescending.</p>

<p>Maya stammered helplessly:</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s such a nice, elegant gentleman, and he’s never done you any
harm so far as I know.”</p>

<p>The dragon-fly regarded Jack Christopher contemplatively.</p>

<p>“Yes, he <i>is</i> a dear little fellow,” it replied tenderly
and&mdash;bit Jack’s head off.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<p>Maya thought she was losing her senses. For a long time she couldn’t
utter a sound. In horror she listened to the munching and crunching
above her as the body of Jack Christopher the blue-bottle was being
dismembered.</p>

<p>“Don’t put on so,” said the dragon-fly with its mouth full, chewing.
“Your sensitiveness doesn’t impress me. Are you bees any better? What do
you do? Evidently you are very young still and haven’t looked about in
your own house. When the massacre of the drones takes place in the
summer, the rest of the world is no less shocked and horrified, and
<i>I</i> think with greater justification.”</p>

<p>Maya asked:</p>

<p>“Have you finished up there?” She did not dare to raise her eyes.</p>

<p>“One leg still left,” replied the dragon-fly.</p>

<p>“Do please swallow it. Then I’ll answer you,” cried Maya, who knew
that the drones in the hive <i>had</i> to be killed off in the summer,
and was provoked by the dragon-fly’s stupidity. “But don’t you dare to
come a step closer. If you do I’ll use my sting on you.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<p>Little Maya had really lost her temper. It was the first time she had
mentioned her sting and the first time she felt glad that she possessed
the weapon.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly threw her a wicked glance. It had finished its meal
and sat with its head slightly ducked, fixing Maya with its eyes and
looking like a beast of prey about to pounce. The little bee was quite
calm now. Where she got her courage from she couldn’t have told, but she
was no longer afraid. She set up a very fine clear buzzing as she had
once heard a sentinel do when a wasp came near the entrance of the
hive.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly said slowly and threateningly:</p>

<p>“Dragon-flies live on the best terms with the nation of bees.”</p>

<p>“Very sensible in them,” flashed Maya.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insinuate that I am afraid of you&mdash;I of you?”
With a jerk the dragon-fly let go of the rush, which sprang back into
its former position, and flew off with a whirr and sparkle of its wings,
straight down to the surface of the water, where it made a superb
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
appearance reflected in the mirror of the lake. You’d have thought there
were two dragon-flies. Both moved their crystal wings so swiftly and
finely that it seemed as though a brilliant sheen of silver were
streaming around them.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic042.png" width = "316" height = "174"
alt = "the dragonfly">
</p>

<p>Maya quite forgot her grief over poor Jack Christopher and all sense
of her own danger.</p>

<p>“How lovely! How lovely!” she cried enthusiastically, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>“Do you mean me?” The dragon-fly spoke in astonishment, but quickly
added: “Yes, I&nbsp;must admit I am fairly presentable. Yesterday I was
flying along the brook, and you should have heard some human beings who
were lying on the bank rave over&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“Human beings!” exclaimed Maya. “Oh my, did you see human
beings?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered the dragon-fly. “But you’ll be very interested
to know my name, I’m sure. My name is Loveydear, of the order Odonata,
of the family Libellulidæ.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell me about human beings,” implored Maya, after she had
introduced herself.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly seemed won over. She
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
seated herself on the leaf beside Maya. And the little bee let her,
knowing Miss Loveydear would be careful not to come too close.</p>

<p>“Have human beings a sting?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, what would they do with a sting! No, they have worse
weapons against us, and they are very dangerous. There isn’t a soul who
isn’t afraid of them, especially of the little ones whose two legs
show&mdash;the boys.”</p>

<p>“Do they try to catch you?” asked Maya, breathless with
excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, can’t you understand why?” Miss Loveydear glanced at her wings.
“I have seldom met a human being who hasn’t tried to catch&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“But why?” asked Maya in a tremor.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Miss Loveydear, with a modest smirk and a drooping,
sidewise glance, “there’s something attractive about us dragon-flies.
That’s the only reason I know. Some members of our family who let
themselves be caught went through the cruellest tortures and finally
died.”</p>

<p>“Were they eaten up?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<p>“No, no, not exactly that,” said Miss Loveydear comfortingly. “So far
as is known, man does not feed on dragon-flies. But sometimes he has
murderous desires, a&nbsp;lust for killing, which will probably never be
explained. You may not believe it, but cases have actually occurred of
the so-called boy-men catching dragon-flies and pulling off their legs
and wings for pure pleasure. You doubt it, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I doubt it,” cried Maya indignantly.</p>

<p>Miss Loveydear shrugged her glistening shoulders. Her face looked old
with knowledge.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said after a pause, grieving and pale, “if only one could
speak of these things openly. I&nbsp;had a brother who gave promise of a
splendid future, only, I’m sorry to say, he was a little reckless and
dreadfully curious. A&nbsp;boy once threw a net over him, a&nbsp;net
fastened to a long pole.&mdash;Who would dream of a thing like that?
Tell me. Would you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the little bee, “never. I should never have thought of
such a thing.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<p>The dragon-fly looked at her.</p>

<p>“A black cord was tied round his waist between his wings, so that he
could fly, but not fly away, not escape. Each time my brother thought he
had got his liberty, he would be jerked back horribly within the boy’s
reach.”</p>

<p>Maya shook her head.</p>

<p>“You don’t dare even think of it,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“If a day passes when I don’t think of it,” said the dragon-fly, “I
am sure to dream of it. One misfortune followed another. My brother soon
died.” Miss Loveydear heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“What did he die of?” asked Maya, in genuine sympathy.</p>

<p>Miss Loveydear could not reply at once. Great tears welled up and
rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“He was stuck in a pocket,” she sobbed. “No one can stand being stuck
in a pocket.”</p>

<p>“But what is a pocket?” Maya could hardly take in so many new and
awful things all at once.</p>

<p>“A pocket,” Miss Loveydear explained, “is
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
a store-room that men have in their outer hide.&mdash;And what else do
you think was in the pocket when my brother was stuck into it? Oh, the
dreadful company in which my poor brother had to draw his last breath!
You’ll never guess!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Maya, all in a quiver, “no, I don’t think I
can.&mdash;Honey, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Not likely,” observed Miss Loveydear with an air of mingled
importance and distress. “You’ll seldom find honey in the pockets of
human beings. I’ll tell you.&mdash;A frog was in the pocket, and a
pen-knife, and a carrot. Well?”</p>

<p>“Horrible,” whispered Maya.&mdash;“What <i>is</i> a pen-knife?”</p>

<p>“A pen-knife, in a way, is a human being’s sting, an artificial one.
They are denied a sting by nature, so they try to imitate it.&mdash;The
frog, thank goodness, was nearing his end. One eye was gone, one leg was
broken, and his lower jaw was dislocated. Yet, for all that, the moment
my brother was stuck in the pocket he hissed at him out of his crooked
mouth:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<p>“‘As soon as I am well, I will swallow you.’</p>

<p>“With his remaining eye he glared at my brother, and in the
half-light of the prison you can imagine what an effect the look he gave
him must have had&mdash;fearful!&mdash;Then something even more horrible
happened. The pocket was suddenly shaken, my brother was pressed against
the dying frog and his wings stuck to its cold, wet body. He went off in
a faint.&mdash;Oh, the misery of it! There are no words to
describe&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>“How did you find all this out?” Maya was so horrified she could
scarcely frame the question.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” replied Miss Loveydear. “After a while the boy got
hungry and dug into his pocket for the carrot. It was under my brother
and the frog, and the boy threw them away first.&mdash;I heard my
brother’s cry for help, and found him lying beside the frog on the
grass. I&nbsp;reached him only in time to hear the whole story before he
breathed his last. He put his arms round my neck and kissed me farewell.
Then he died&mdash;bravely
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
and without complaining, like a little hero. When his crushed wings had
given their last quiver, I&nbsp;laid an oak leaf over his body and went
to look for a sprig of forget-me-nots to put upon his grave. ‘Sleep
well, my little brother,’ I&nbsp;cried, and flew off in the quiet of the
evening. I&nbsp;flew toward the two red suns, the one in the sky and the
one in the lake. No one has ever felt as sad and solemn as I did
then.&mdash;Have you ever had a sorrow in your life? Perhaps you’ll tell
me about it some other time.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Maya. “As a matter of fact, until now I have always been
happy.”</p>

<p>“You may thank your lucky stars,” said Miss Loveydear with a note of
disappointment in her voice.</p>

<p>Maya asked about the frog.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>him</i>,” said Miss Loveydear. “He, it is presumed, met with
the end he deserved. The hard-heartedness of him, to frighten a dying
person! When I found him on the grass beside my brother, he was trying
to get away. But on account of his broken leg and one eye gone, all he
could do was hop round
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
in a circle and hop round in a circle. He looked too comical for words.
‘The stork’ll soon get ye,’ I&nbsp;called to him as I flew away.”</p>

<p>“Poor frog!” said little Maya.</p>

<p>“Poor frog! Poor frog indeed! That’s going too far. Pitying a frog.
The idea! To feel sorry for a frog is like clipping your own wings. You
seem to have no principles.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But it’s hard for me to see <i>any</i> one suffer.”</p>

<p>“Oh”&mdash;Miss Loveydear comforted her&mdash;“that’s because you’re
so young. You’ll learn to bear it in time. Cheerio, my dear.&mdash;But I
must be getting into the sunshine. It’s pretty cold here. Good-by!”</p>

<p>A faint rustle and the gleam of a thousand colors, lovely pale colors
like the glints in running water and clear gems.</p>

<p>Miss Loveydear swung through the green rushes out over the surface of
the water. Maya heard her singing in the sunshine. She stood and
listened. It was a fine song, with something of the melancholy sweetness
of a folksong, and it filled the little bee’s heart with mingled
happiness and sadness.</p>

<p>“Listen!” a white butterfly called to its friend. “Listen to the song
of the dragon-fly.” The light creatures rocked close to Maya, and rocked
away again into the radiant blue day. Then Maya also lifted her wings,
buzzed farewell to the silvery lake, and flew inland.</p>

CHAPTER IV</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">EFFIE AND BOBBIE</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">When</span>
Maya awoke the next morning in the corolla of a blue canterbury bell,
she heard a fine, faint rustling in the air and felt her blossom-bed
quiver as from a tiny, furtive tap-tapping. Through the open corolla
came a damp whiff of grass and earth, and the air was quite chill. In
some apprehension, she took a little pollen from the yellow stamens,
scrupulously performed her toilet, then, warily, picking her steps,
ventured to the outer edge of the drooping blossom. It was raining!
A&nbsp;fine cool rain was coming down with a light plash, covering
everything all round with millions of
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
bright silver pearls, which clung to the leaves and flowers, rolled down
the green paths of the blades of grass, and refreshed the brown
soil.</p>

<p>What a change in the world! It was the first time in the child-bee’s
young life that she had seen rain. It filled her with wonder; it
delighted her. Yet she was a little troubled. She remembered Cassandra’s
warning never to fly abroad in the rain. It must be difficult, she
realized, to move your wings when the drops beat them down. And the cold
really hurt, and she missed the quiet golden sunshine that gladdened the
earth and made it a place free from all care.</p>

<p>It seemed to be very early still. The animal life in the grass was
just beginning. From the concealment of her lofty bluebell Maya
commanded a splendid view of the social life coming awake beneath.
Watching it she forgot, for the moment, her anxiety and mounting
homesickness. It was too amusing for anything to be safe in a
hiding-place, high up, and look down on the doings of the grass-dwellers
below.</p>

<p>Slowly, however, her thoughts went back&mdash;back
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
to the home she had left, to the bee-state, and to the protection of its
close solidarity. There, on this rainy day, the bees would be sitting
together, glad of the day of rest, doing a little construction here and
there on the cells, or feeding the larvæ. Yet, on the whole, the hive
was very quiet and Sunday-like when it rained. Only, sometimes
messengers would fly out to see how the weather was and from what
quarter the wind was blowing. The queen would go about her kingdom from
story to story, testing things, bestowing a word of praise or blame,
laying an egg here and there, and bringing happiness with her royal
presence wherever she went. She might pat one of the younger bees on the
head to show her approval of what it had already done, or she might ask
it about its new experiences. How delighted a bee would be to catch a
glance or receive a gracious word from the queen!</p>

<p>Oh, thought Maya, how happy it made you to be able to count yourself
one in a community like that, to feel that everybody respected you, and
you had the powerful protection
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
of the state. Here, out in the world, lonely and exposed, she ran great
risks of her life. She was cold, too. And supposing the rain were to
keep up! What would she do, how could she find something to eat? There
was scarcely any honey-juice in the canterbury bell, and the pollen
would soon give out.</p>

<p>For the first time Maya realized how necessary the sunshine is for a
life of vagabondage. Hardly anyone would set out on adventure, she
thought, if it weren’t for the sunshine. The very recollection of it was
cheering, and she glowed with secret pride that she had had the daring
to start life on her own hook. The number of things she had already seen
and experienced! More, ever so much more, than the other bees were
likely to know in a whole lifetime. Experience was the most precious
thing in life, worth any sacrifice, she thought.</p>

<p>A troop of migrating ants were passing by, and singing as they
marched through the cool forest of grass. They seemed to be in a hurry.
Their crisp morning song, in rhythm with their march, touched the little
bee’s heart with melancholy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<div class = "poem">
<p>Few our days on earth shall be,</p>
<p class = "indent">Fast the moments flit;</p>
<p>First-class robbers such as we</p>
<p class = "indent">Do not care a bit!</p>
</div>

<p>They were extraordinarily well armed and looked saucy, bold and
dangerous.</p>

<p>The song died away under the leaves of the coltsfoot. But some
mischief seemed to have been done there. A&nbsp;rough, hoarse voice
sounded, and the small leaves of a young dandelion were energetically
thrust aside. Maya saw a corpulent blue beetle push its way out. It
looked like a half-sphere of dark metal, shimmering with lights of blue
and green and occasional black. It may have been two or even three times
her size. Its hard sheath looked as though nothing could destroy it, and
its deep voice positively frightened you.</p>

<p>The song of the soldiers, apparently, had roused him out of sleep. He
was cross. His hair was still rumpled, and he rubbed the sleep out of
his cunning little blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Make way, <i>I’m</i> coming. Make way.”</p>

<p>He seemed to think that people should step
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
aside at the mere announcement of his approach.</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord I’m not in his way,” thought Maya, feeling very safe
in her high, swaying nook of concealment. Nevertheless her heart went
pit-a-pat, and she withdrew a little deeper into the flower-bell.</p>

<p>The beetle moved with a clumsy lurch through the wet grass,
presenting a not exactly elegant appearance. Directly under Maya’s
blossom was a withered leaf. Here he stopped, shoved the leaf aside, and
made a step backward. Maya saw a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>“Well,” she thought, all a-gog with curiosity, “the things there
<i>are</i> in the world. I&nbsp;never thought of such a thing. Life’s
not long enough for all there is to see.”</p>

<p>She kept very quiet. The only sound was the soft pelting of the rain.
Then she heard the beetle calling down the hole:</p>

<p>“If you want to go hunting with me, you’ll have to make up your mind
to get right up. It’s already bright daylight.” He was feeling so very
superior for having waked up first
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
that it was hard for him to be pleasant.</p>

<p>A few moments passed before the answer came. Then Maya heard a thin,
chirping voice rise out of the hole.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, do close the door up there. It’s
raining&nbsp;in.”</p>

<p>The beetle obeyed. He stood in an expectant attitude, his head cocked
a little to one side, and squinted through the crack.</p>

<p>“Please hurry,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>Maya was tense with eagerness to see what sort of a creature would
come out of the hole. She crept so far out on the edge of the blossom
that a drop of rain fell on her shoulder, and gave her a start. She
wiped herself dry.</p>

<p>Below her the withered leaf heaved; a brown insect crept out, slowly.
Maya thought it was the queerest specimen she had ever seen. It had a
plump body, set on extremely thin, slow-moving legs, and a fearfully
thick head, with little upright feelers. It looked flustered.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Effie dear.” The beetle went slim with politeness. He
was all politeness, and his body seemed really slim. “How
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
did you sleep? How did you sleep, my precious&mdash;my all?”</p>

<p>Effie took his hand rather stonily.</p>

<p>“It can’t be, Bobbie,” she said. “I can’t go with you. We’re creating
too much talk.”</p>

<p>Poor Bobbie looked quite alarmed.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” he stammered. “I don’t understand.&mdash;Is our
new-found happiness to be wrecked by such nonsense? Effie,
think&mdash;think the thing over. What do <i>you</i> care <i>what</i>
people say? You have your hole, you can creep into it whenever you like,
and if you go down far enough, you won’t hear a syllable.”</p>

<p>Effie smiled a sad, superior smile.</p>

<p>“Bobbie, you don’t understand. I have my own views in the
matter.&mdash;Besides, there’s something else. You have been exceedingly
indelicate. You took advantage of my ignorance. You let me think you
were a rose-beetle and yesterday the snail told me you are a tumble-bug.
A&nbsp;considerable difference! He saw you engaged in&mdash;well, doing
something I don’t care to mention. I’m sure you will now admit that I
must take back my word.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<p>Bobbie was stunned. When he recovered from the shock he burst out
angrily:</p>

<p>“No, I <i>don’t</i> understand. I can’t understand. I want to be
loved for myself, and not for my business.”</p>

<p>“If only it weren’t dung,” said Effie offishly, “anything but dung,
I&nbsp;shouldn’t be so particular.&mdash;And please remember, I’m a
young widow who lost her husband only three days ago under the most
tragic circumstances&mdash;he was gobbled up by the shrewmouse&mdash;and
it isn’t proper for me to be gadding about. A&nbsp;young widow should
lead a life of complete retirement. So&mdash;good-by.”</p>

<p>Pop into her hole went Effie, as though a puff of wind had blown her
away. Maya would never have thought it possible that anyone could dive
into the ground as fast as that.</p>

<p>Effie was gone, and Bobbie stared in blank bewilderment down the
empty dark opening, looking so utterly stupid that Maya had to
laugh.</p>

<p>Finally he roused, and shook his small round head in angry distress.
His feelers
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
drooped dismally like two rain-soaked fans.</p>

<p>“People now-a-days no longer appreciate fineness of character and
respectability,” he sighed. “Effie is heartless. I&nbsp;didn’t dare
admit it to myself, but she is, she’s absolutely heartless. But even if
she hasn’t got the <i>right feelings</i>, she ought to have the <i>good
sense</i> to be my wife.”</p>

<p>Maya saw the tears come to his eyes, and her heart was seized with
pity.</p>

<p>But the next instant Bobbie stirred. He wiped the tears away and
crept cautiously behind a small mound of earth, which his friend had
probably shoveled out of her dwelling. A&nbsp;little flesh-colored
earthworm was coming along through the grass. It had the queerest way of
propelling itself, by first making itself long and thin, then short and
thick. Its cylinder of a body consisted of nothing but delicate rings
that pushed and groped forward noiselessly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, startling Maya, Bobbie made one step out of his
hiding-place, caught hold of the worm, bit it in two, and began calmly
to eat the one half, heedless of its desperate wriggling
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
or the wriggling of the other half in the grass. It was a tiny little
worm.</p>

<p>“Patience,” said Bobbie, “it will soon be over.”</p>

<p>But while he chewed, his thoughts seemed to revert to Effie, his
Effie, whom he had lost forever and aye, and great tears rolled down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>Maya pitied him from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” she thought, “there certainly is a lot of sadness in the
world.”</p>

<p>At that moment she saw the half of the worm which Bobbie had set
aside, making a hasty departure.</p>

<p>“Did you <i>ever</i> see the like!” she cried, surprised into such a
loud tone that Bobbie looked around wondering where the sound had come
from.</p>

<p>“Make way!” he called.</p>

<p>“But I’m not in your way,” said Maya.</p>

<p>“Where are you then? You must be somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Up here. Up above you. In the bluebell.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, but I’m no grasshopper. I
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
can’t turn my head up far enough to see you. Why did you scream?”</p>

<p>“The half of the worm is running away.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie, looking after the retreating fraction, “the
creatures are very lively.&mdash;I’ve lost my appetite.” With that he
threw away the remnant which he was still holding in his hand, and this
worm portion also retreated, in the other direction.</p>

<p>Maya was completely puzzled. But Bobbie seemed to be familiar with
this peculiarity of worms.</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose that I always eat worms,” he remarked. “You see, you
don’t find roses everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Tell the little one at least which way its other half ran,” cried
Maya in great excitement.</p>

<p>Bobbie shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“Those whom fate has rent asunder, let no man join together again,”
he observed.&mdash;“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Maya, of the nation of bees.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it. I have nothing against the bees.&mdash;Why are
you sitting about?
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
Bees don’t usually sit about. Have you been sitting there long?”</p>

<p>“I slept here.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” There was a note of suspicion in Bobbie’s voice. “I hope
you slept well, <i>very</i> well. Did you just wake&nbsp;up?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Maya, who had shrewdly guessed that Bobbie would not like
her having overheard his conversation with Effie, the cricket, and did
not want to hurt his feelings again.</p>

<p>Bobbie ran hither and thither trying to look up and see Maya.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said. “If I raise myself on my hind legs and lean against
that blade of grass I’ll be able to see you, and you’ll be able to look
into my eyes. You want to, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, I do indeed. I’d like to very much.”</p>

<p>Bobbie found a suitable prop, the stem of a buttercup. The flower
tipped a little to one side so that Maya could see him perfectly as he
raised himself on his hind legs and looked up at her. She thought he had
a nice, dear, friendly face&mdash;but not so very young any more and
cheeks rather too plump. He bowed, setting
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
the buttercup a-rocking, and introduced himself:</p>

<p>“Bobbie, of the family of rose-beetles.”</p>

<p>Maya had to laugh to herself. She knew very well he was not a
rose-beetle; he was a dung-beetle. But she passed the matter over in
silence, not caring to mortify him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you mind the rain?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I’m accustomed to the rain&mdash;from the roses, you know.
It’s usually raining there.”</p>

<p>Maya thought to herself:</p>

<p>“After all I must punish him a little for his brazen lies. He’s so
frightfully vain.”</p>

<p>“Bobbie,” she said with a sly smile, “what sort of a hole is that one
there, under the leaf?”</p>

<p>Bobbie started.</p>

<p>“A hole? A hole, did you say? There are very many holes round here.
It’s probably just an ordinary hole. You have no idea how many holes
there are in the ground.”</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic059.png" width = "244" height = "222"
alt = "Bobbie on his back">
</p>

<p>Bobbie had hardly uttered the last word when something dreadful
happened. In his eagerness to appear indifferent he had lost his balance
and toppled over. Maya heard a despairing shriek, and the next instant
saw the
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
beetle lying flat on his back in the grass, his arms and legs waving
pitifully in the air.</p>

<p>“I’m done for,” he wailed, “I’m done for. I can’t get back on my feet
again. I’ll never be able to get back on my feet again. I’ll die. I’ll
die in this position. Have you ever heard of a worse fate!”</p>

<p>He carried on so that he did not hear Maya trying to comfort him. And
he kept making efforts to touch the ground with his feet. But each time
he’d painfully get hold of a bit of earth, it would give way, and he’d
fall over again on his high half-sphere of a back. The case looked
really desperate, and Maya was honestly concerned; he was already quite
pale in the face and his cries were heart-rending.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand it, I can’t stand this position,” he yelled. “At least
turn your head away. Don’t torture a dying man with your inquisitive
stares.&mdash;If only I could reach a blade of grass, or the stem of the
buttercup. You can’t hold on to the air. Nobody can do that. Nobody can
hold on to the air.”</p>

<p>Maya’s heart was quivering with pity.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she cried, “I’ll try to turn you over.
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
If I try very hard I am bound to succeed. But Bobbie, <i>Bobbie</i>,
dear man, don’t yell like that. Listen to me. If I bend a blade of grass
over and reach the tip of it to you, will you be able to use it and save
yourself?”</p>

<p>Bobbie had no ears for her suggestion. Frightened out of his senses,
he did nothing but kick and scream.</p>

<p>So little Maya, in spite of the rain, flew out of her cover over to a
slim green blade of grass beside Bobbie, and clung to it near the tip.
It bent under her weight and sank directly above Bobbie’s wriggling
limbs. Maya gave a little cry of delight.</p>

<p>“Catch hold of it,” she called.</p>

<p>Bobbie felt something tickle his face and quickly grabbed at it,
first with one hand, then with the other, and finally with his legs,
which had splendid sharp claws, two each. Bit by bit he drew himself
along the blade until he reached the base, where it was thicker and
stronger, and he was able to turn himself over on&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>He heaved a tremendous sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he exclaimed. “That was
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
awful. But for my presence of mind I should have fallen a victim to your
talkativeness.”</p>

<p>“Are you feeling better?” asked Maya.</p>

<p>Bobbie clutched his forehead.</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks. When this dizziness passes, I’ll tell you all
about&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>But Maya never got the answer to her question. A field-sparrow came
hopping through the grass in search of insects, and the little bee
pressed herself close to the ground and kept very quiet until the bird
had gone. When she looked around for Bobbie he had disappeared. So she
too made off; for the rain had stopped and the day was clear and
warm.</p>

CHAPTER V</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE ACROBAT</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Oh,</span>
what a day!</p>

<p>The dew had fallen early in the morning, and when the sun rose and
cast its slanting beams across the forest of grass, there was such a
sparkling and glistening and gleaming that you didn’t know what to say
or do for sheer ecstasy, it was so beautiful, so beautiful!</p>

<p>The moment Maya awoke, glad sounds greeted her from all round. Some
came out of the trees, from the throats of the birds, the dreaded
creatures who could yet produce such exquisite song; other happy calls
came out of the air, from flying insects, or out of the grass
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
and the bushes, from bugs and flies, big ones and little ones.</p>

<p>Maya had made it very comfortable for herself in a hole in a tree. It
was safe and dry, and stayed warm the greater part of the night because
the sun shone on the entrance all day long. Once, early in the morning,
she had heard a woodpecker rat-a-tat-tatting on the bark of the trunk,
and had lost no time getting away. The drumming of a woodpecker is as
terrifying to a little insect in the bark of a tree as the breaking open
of our shutters by a burglar would be to us. But at night she was safe
in her lofty nook. At night no creatures came prying.</p>

<p>She had sealed up part of the entrance with wax, leaving just space
enough to slip in and out; and in a cranny in the back of the hole,
where it was dark and cool, she had stored a little honey against rainy
days.</p>

<p>This morning she swung herself out into the sunshine with a cry of
delight, all anticipation as to what the fresh, lovely day might bring.
She sailed straight through the golden air, looking like a brisk dot
driven by the wind.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<p>“I am going to meet a human being to-day,” she cried. “I feel sure I
am. On days like this human beings must certainly be out in the open air
enjoying nature.”</p>

<p>Never had she met so many insects. There was a coming and going and
all sorts of doings; the air was alive with a humming and a laughing and
glad little cries. You had to join in, you just <i>had</i> to
join&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>After a while Maya let herself down into a forest of grass, where all
sorts of plants and flowers were growing. The highest were the white
tufts of yarrow and butterfly-weed&mdash;the flaming milkweed that drew
you like a magnet. She took a sip of nectar from some clover and was
about to fly off again when she saw a perfect droll of a beast perched
on a blade of grass curving above her flower. She was thoroughly
scared&mdash;he was such a lean green monster&mdash;but then her
interest was tremendously aroused, and she remained sitting still, as
though rooted to the spot, and stared straight at him.</p>

<p>At first glance you’d have thought he had horns. Looking closer you
saw it was his oddly
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
protuberant forehead that gave this impression. Two long, long feelers
fine as the finest thread grew out of his brows, and his body was the
slimmest imaginable, and green all over, even to his eyes. He had dainty
forelegs and thin, inconspicuous wings that couldn’t be very practical,
Maya thought. Oddest of all were his great hindlegs, which stuck up over
his body like two jointed stilts. His sly, saucy expression was
contradicted by the look of astonishment in his eyes, and you couldn’t
say there was any meanness in his eyes either. No, rather a lot of good
humor.</p>

<p>“Well, mademoiselle,” he said to Maya, evidently annoyed by her
surprised expression, “never seen a grasshopper before? Or are you
laying eggs?”</p>

<p>“The idea!” cried Maya in shocked accents. “It wouldn’t occur to me.
Even if I could, I&nbsp;wouldn’t. It would be usurping the sacred duties
of our queen. I&nbsp;wouldn’t do such a foolish thing.”</p>

<p>The grasshopper ducked his head and made such a funny face that Maya
had to laugh out loud in spite of her chagrin.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<p>“Mademoiselle,” he began, then had to laugh himself, and said:
“You’re a case! You’re a case!”</p>

<p>The fellow’s behavior made Maya impatient.</p>

<p>“Why do you laugh?” she asked in a not altogether friendly tone. “You
can’t be serious expecting me to lay eggs, especially out here on the
grass.”</p>

<p>There was a snap. “Hoppety-hop,” said the grasshopper, and was
gone.</p>

<p>Maya was utterly non-plussed. Without the help of his wings he had
swung himself up in the air in a tremendous curve. Foolhardiness
bordering on madness, she thought.</p>

<p>But there he was again. From where, she couldn’t tell, but there he
was, beside her, on a leaf of her clover.</p>

<p>He looked her up and down, all round, before and behind.</p>

<p>“No,” he said then, pertly, “you certainly can’t lay eggs. You’re not
equipped for it. You haven’t got a borer.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;borer?” Maya covered herself
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
with her wings and turned so that the stranger could see nothing but her
face.</p>

<p>“Borer, that’s what I said.&mdash;Don’t fall off your base,
mademoiselle.&mdash;You’re a wasp, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>To be called a wasp! Nothing worse could happen to little Maya.</p>

<p>“I <i>never</i>!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Hoppety-hop,” answered he, and was off again.</p>

<p>“The fellow makes me nervous,” she thought, and decided to fly away.
She couldn’t remember ever having been so insulted in her life. What a
disgrace to be mistaken for a wasp, one of those useless wasps, those
tramps, those common thieves! It really was infuriating.</p>

<p>But there he was again!</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he called and turned round part way, so that his long
hindlegs looked like the hands of a clock standing at five minutes
before half-past seven, “mademoiselle, you must excuse me for
interrupting our conversation now and then. But suddenly I’m seized.
I&nbsp;must hop. I&nbsp;can’t help
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
it, I&nbsp;must hop, no matter where. Can’t you hop, too?”</p>

<p>He smiled a smile that drew his mouth from ear to ear. Maya couldn’t
keep from laughing.</p>

<p>“Can you?” said the grasshopper, and nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Who <i>are</i> you?” asked Maya. “You’re terribly exciting.”</p>

<p>“Why, everybody knows who I am,” said the green oddity, and grinned
almost beyond the limits of his jaws.</p>

<p>Maya never could make out whether he spoke in fun or in earnest.</p>

<p>“I’m a stranger in these parts,” she replied pleasantly, “else I’m
sure I’d know you.&mdash;But please note that I belong to the family of
bees, and am positively not a wasp.”</p>

<p>“My goodness,” said the grasshopper, “one and the same thing.”</p>

<p>Maya couldn’t utter a sound, she was so excited.</p>

<p>“You’re uneducated,” she burst out at length. “Take a good look at a
wasp once.”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” answered the green one.
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
“What good would it do if I observed differences that exist only in
people’s imagination? You, a&nbsp;bee, fly round in the air, sting
everything you come across, and can’t hop. Exactly the same with a wasp.
So where’s the difference? Hoppety-hop!” And he was gone.</p>

<p>“But now I am going to fly away,” thought Maya.</p>

<p>There he was again.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he called, “there’s going to be a hopping-match
to-morrow. It will be held in the Reverend Sinpeck’s garden. Would you
care to have a complimentary ticket and watch the games? My old woman
has two left over. She’ll trade you one for a compliment. I&nbsp;expect
to break the record.”</p>

<p>“I’m not interested in hopping acrobatics,” said Maya in some
disgust. “A person who flies has <i>higher</i> interests.”</p>

<p>The grasshopper grinned a grin you could almost hear.</p>

<p>“Don’t think <i>too</i> highly of yourself, my dear young lady. Most
creatures in this world can fly, but only a very, very few can hop. You
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
don’t understand other people’s interests. You have no vision. Even
human beings would like a high elegant hop. The other day I saw the
Reverend Sinpeck hop a yard up into the air to impress a little snake
that slid across his road. His contempt for anything that couldn’t hop
was so great that he threw away his pipe. And reverends, you know,
cannot live without their pipes. I&nbsp;have known
grasshoppers&mdash;members of my own family&mdash;who could hop to a
height three hundred times their length. <i>Now</i> you’re impressed.
You haven’t a word to say. And you’re inwardly regretting the remarks
you made and the remarks you intended to make. Three hundred times their
own length! Just imagine. Even the elephant, the largest animal in the
world, can’t hop as high as that. Well? You’re not saying anything.
Didn’t I tell you you wouldn’t have anything to say?”</p>

<p>“But how <i>can</i> I say anything if you don’t give me a
chance?”</p>

<p>“All right, then, talk,” said the grasshopper pleasantly.
“Hoppety-hop.” He was gone.</p>

</p>

<p>Maya had to laugh in spite of her irritation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<p>The fellow had certainly furnished her with a strange experience.
Buffoon though he was, still she had to admire his wide information and
worldly wisdom; and though she could not agree with his views of
hopping, she was amazed by all the new things he had taught her in their
brief conversation. If he had been more reliable she would have been
only too glad to ask him questions about a number of different things.
It occurred to her that often people who are least equipped to profit by
experiences are the very ones who have them.</p>

<p>He knew the names of human beings. Did he, then, understand their
language? If he came back, she’d ask him. And she’d also ask him what he
thought of trying to go near a human being or of entering a human
being’s house.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle!” A blade of grass beside Maya was set swaying.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious! Where do you keep coming from?”</p>

<p>“The surroundings.”</p>

<p>“But do tell, do you hop out into the world
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
just so, without knowing where you mean to land?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Why not? Can <i>you</i> read the future? No one can. Only
the tree-toad, but he never tells.”</p>

<p>“The things you know! Wonderful, simply wonderful!&mdash;Do you
understand the language of human beings?”</p>

<p>“That’s a difficult question to answer, mademoiselle, because it
hasn’t been proved as yet whether human beings have a language.
Sometimes they utter sounds by which they seem to reach an understanding
with each other&mdash;but such awful sounds! So unmelodious! Like
nothing else in nature that I know of. However, there’s one thing you
must allow them: they do seem to try to make their voices pleasanter.
Once I saw two boys take a blade of grass between their thumbs and blow
on it. The result was a whistle which may be compared with the chirping
of a cricket, though far inferior in quality of tone, far inferior.
However, human beings make an honest effort.&mdash;Is there anything
else you’d like to ask? I&nbsp;know a thing or two.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<p>He grinned his almost-audible grin.</p>

<p>But the next time he hopped off, Maya waited for him in vain. She
looked about in the grass and the flowers; he was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

CHAPTER VI</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">PUCK</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Maya,</span>
drowsy with the noonday heat, flew leisurely past the glare on the
bushes in the garden, into the cool, broad-leaved shelter of a great
chestnut-tree.</p>

<p>On the trodden sward in the shade under the tree stood chairs and
tables, evidently for an out-door meal. A&nbsp;short distance away
gleamed the red-tiled roof of a peasant’s cottage, with thin blue
columns of smoke curling up from the chimneys.</p>

<p>Now at last, thought Maya, she was bound to see a human being. Had
she not reached the very heart of his realm? The tree must
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
be his property, and the curious wooden contrivances in the shade below
must belong to his hive.</p>

<p>Something buzzed; a fly alighted on the leaf beside her. It ran up
and down the green veining in little jerks. You couldn’t see its legs
move, and it seemed to be sliding about excitedly. Then it flew from one
finger of the broad leaf to another, but so quickly and unexpectedly
that you might have thought it hadn’t flown but hopped. Evidently it was
looking for the most comfortable place on the leaf. Every now and then,
in the <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">suddennest</ins>
way, it would swing itself up in the air a
short space and buzz vehemently, as though something dreadfully untoward
had occurred, or as though it were animated by some tremendous purpose.
Then it would drop back to the leaf, as if nothing had happened, and
resume its jerky racing up and down. Lastly, it would sit quite still,
like a rigid image.</p>

<p>Maya watched its antics in the sunshine, then approached it and said
politely:</p>

<p>“How do you do? Welcome to my leaf. You are a fly, are you not?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<p>“What else do you take me for?” said the little one. “My name is
Puck. I&nbsp;am very busy. Do you want to drive me away?”</p>

<p>“Why, not at all. I am glad to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” was all Puck said, and with that he tried to pull
his head off.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” cried Maya.</p>

<p>“I must do this. You don’t understand. It’s something you know
nothing about,” Puck rejoined calmly, and slid his legs over his wings
till they curved round the tip of his body. “I’m more than a fly,” he
added with some pride. “I’m a housefly. I&nbsp;flew out here for the
fresh air.”</p>

<p>“How interesting!” exclaimed Maya gleefully. “Then you must know all
about human beings.”</p>

<p>“As well as the pockets of my trousers,” Puck threw out disdainfully.
“I sit on them every day. Didn’t you know <i>that</i>? I&nbsp;thought
you bees were so <i>clever</i>. You pretend to be at any rate.”</p>

<p>“My name is Maya,” said the little bee rather shyly. Where the other
insects got
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
their self-assurance, to say nothing of their insolence, she couldn’t
understand.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the information. Whatever your name, you’re a
simpleton.”</p>

<p>Puck sat there tilted like a cannon in position to be fired off, his
head and breast thrust upward, the hind tip of his body resting on the
leaf. Suddenly he ducked his head and squatted down, so that he looked
as if he had no legs.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to watch out and be careful,” he said. “That’s the most
important thing of all.”</p>

<p>But an angry wave of resentment was surging in little Maya. The
insult Puck had offered her was too much. Without really knowing what
made her do it, she pounced on him quick as lightning, caught him by the
collar and held him tight.</p>

<p>“I will teach you to be polite to a bee,” she cried.</p>

<p>Puck set up an awful howl.</p>

<p>“Don’t sting me,” he screamed. “It’s the only thing you can do, but
it’s killing. Please remove the back of your body. That’s where
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
your sting is. And let me go, please let me go, if you possibly can.
I’ll do anything you say. Can’t you understand a joke, a&nbsp;mere joke?
Everybody knows that you bees are the most respected of all insects, and
the most powerful, and the most numerous. Only don’t kill me, please
don’t. There won’t be any bringing me back to life. Good God! No one
appreciates my humor!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Maya with a touch of contempt in her heart, “I’ll
let you live on condition that you tell me everything you know about
human beings.”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” cried Puck. “I’d have told you anyhow. But please let me go
now.”</p>

<p>Maya released him. She had stopped caring. Her respect for the fly
and any confidence she might have had in him were gone. Of what value
could the experiences of so low, so vulgar a creature be to
serious-minded people? She would have to find out about human beings for
herself.</p>

<p>The lesson, however, had not been wasted. Puck was much more
endurable now. Scolding and growling he set himself to rights. He
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
smoothed down his feelers and wings and the minute hairs on his black
body&mdash;which were fearfully rumpled; for the girl-bee had laid on
good and hard&mdash;and concluded the operation by running his proboscis
in and out several times&mdash;something new to Maya.</p>

<p>“Out of joint, completely out of joint!” he muttered in a pained
tone. “Comes of your excited way of doing things. Look. See for
yourself. The sucking-disk at the end of my proboscis looks like a
twisted pewter plate.”</p>

<p>“Have you a sucking-disk?” asked Maya.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious, of course!&mdash;Now tell me. What do you want to
know about human beings?&mdash;Never mind about my proboscis being out
of joint. It’ll be all right.&mdash;I think I had best tell you a few
things from my own life. You see, I&nbsp;grew up among human beings, so
you’ll hear just what you want to know.”</p>

<p>“You grew up among human beings?”</p>

<p>“Of course. It was in the corner of their room that my mother laid
the egg from which I came. I&nbsp;made my first attempts to walk on
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
their window-shades, and I tested the strength of my wings by flying
from Schiller to Goethe.”</p>

<p>“What are Schiller and Goethe?”</p>

<p>“Statues,” explained Puck, very superior, “statues of two men who
seem to have distinguished themselves. They stand under the mirror, one
on the right hand and one on the left hand, and nobody pays any
attention to them.”</p>

<p>“What’s a mirror? And why do the statues stand under the mirror?”</p>

<p>“A mirror is good for seeing your belly when you crawl on it. It’s
very amusing. When human beings go up to a mirror, they either put their
hands up to their hair, or pull at their beards. When they are alone,
they smile into the mirror, but if somebody else is in the room they
look very serious. What the purpose of it is, I&nbsp;could never make
out. Seems to be some useless game of theirs. I&nbsp;myself, when I was
still a child, suffered a good deal from the mirror. I’d fly into it and
of course be thrown back violently.”</p>

<p>Maya plied Puck with more questions about
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
the mirror, which he found very difficult to answer.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said at last, “you’ve certainly flown over the smooth
surface of water, haven’t you? Well, a&nbsp;mirror is something like it,
only hard and upright.”</p>

<p>The little fly, seeing that Maya listened most respectfully and
attentively to the tale of his experiences, became a good deal
pleasanter in his manners. And as for Maya’s opinion of Puck, although
she didn’t believe everything he told her, still she was sorry she had
thought so slightingly of him earlier in their meeting.</p>

<p>“Often people are far more sensible than we take them to be at
first,” she told herself.</p>

<p>Puck went on with his story.</p>

<p>“It took a long time for me to get to understand their language. Now
at last I know what they want. It isn’t much, because they usually say
the same thing every day.”</p>

<p>“I can scarcely believe it,” said Maya. “Why, they have so many
interests, and think so many things, and do so many things. Cassandra
told me that they build cities so big
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
that you can’t fly round them in one day, towers as high as the nuptial
flight of our queen, houses that float on the water, and houses that
glide across the country on two narrow silver paths and go faster than
birds.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment!” said Puck energetically. “Who is Cassandra? Who is
she, if I may make so bold as to ask? Well?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she was my teacher.”</p>

<p>“Teacher!” repeated Puck contemptuously. “Probably also a bee. Who
but a bee would overestimate human beings like that? Your Miss
Cassandra, or whatever her name is, doesn’t know her history. Those
cities and towers and other human devices you speak of are none of them
any good to us. Who would take such an impractical view of the world as
you do? If you don’t accept the premise that the earth is dominated by
the flies, that the flies are the most widespread and most important
race on earth, you’ll scarcely get a real knowledge of the world.”</p>

<p>Puck took a few excited zigzag turns on the leaf and pulled at his
head, to Maya’s intense concern. However, the little bee had observed
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
by this time that there wasn’t much sense to be got out of his head any
way.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic086.png" width = "261" height = "226"
alt = "Maya and Puck">
</p>

<p>“Do you know how you can tell I am right?” asked Puck, rubbing his
hands together as if to tie them in a knot. “Count the number of people
and the number of flies in any room. The result will surprise you.”</p>

<p>“You may be right. But that’s not the point.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I was born this year?” Puck demanded all of a
sudden.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I passed through a winter,” Puck announced, all pride. “My
experiences date back to the ice age. In a sense they take me
<i>through</i> the ice age. That’s why I’m here&mdash;I’m here to
recuperate.”</p>

<p>“Whatever else you may be, you certainly are spunky,” remarked
Maya.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” exclaimed Puck, and made an airy leap out into the
sunshine. “The flies are the boldest race in creation. We never run away
unless it is better to run away, and then we always come
back.&mdash;Have you ever sat on a human being?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<p>“No,” said Maya, looking at the fly distrustfully out of the corner
of her eye. She still didn’t know quite what to make of him. “No, I’m
not interested in sitting on human beings.”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear child, that’s because you don’t know what it is. If ever
you had seen the fun I have with the man at home, you’d turn green with
envy. I’ll tell you.&mdash;In my room there lives an elderly man who
cherishes the color of his nose by means of a peculiar drink, which he
keeps hidden in the corner cupboard. It has a sweet, intoxicating smell.
When he goes to get it he smiles, and his eyes grow small. He takes a
little glass, and he looks up to the ceiling while he drinks, to see if
I am there. I&nbsp;nod down to him, and he passes his hand over his
forehead, nose and mouth to show me where I am to sit later on. Then he
blinks, and opens his mouth as wide as he can, and pulls down the shade
to keep the afternoon sun from bothering us. Finally he lays himself
down on a something called a sofa, and in a short while begins to make
dull snuffling sounds. I&nbsp;suppose he thinks the sounds are
beautiful. We’ll talk about them some other
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
time. They are man’s slumber song. For me they are the sign that I am to
come down. The first thing I do is to take my portion from the glass,
which he left for me. There’s something tremendously stimulating about a
drop like that. I&nbsp;understand human beings. Then I fly over and take
my place on the forehead of the sleeping man. The forehead lies between
the nose and the hair and serves for thinking. You can tell it does from
the long furrows that go from right to left. They must move whenever a
man thinks if something worth while is to result from his thinking. The
forehead also shows if human beings are annoyed. But then the folds run
up and down, and a round cavity forms over the nose. As soon as I settle
on his forehead and begin to run to and fro in the furrows, the man
makes a snatch in the air with his hands. He thinks I’m somewhere in the
air. That’s because I’m sitting on his think-furrows, and he can’t work
out so quickly where I really am. At last he does. He mutters and jabs
at me. Now then, Miss Maya, or whatever your name is, now then, you’ve
got to have your wits about
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
you. I&nbsp;see the hand coming, but I wait until the last moment, then
I fly nimbly to one side, sit down, and watch him feel to see if I am
still there.&mdash;We kept the game up often for a full half hour. You
have no idea what a lot of endurance the man has. Finally he jumps up
and pours out a string of words which show how ungrateful he is. Well,
what of it? A&nbsp;noble soul seeks no reward. I’m already up on the
ceiling listening to his ungrateful outburst.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I particularly like it,” observed Maya. “Isn’t it rather
useless?”</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to erect a honeycomb on his nose?” exclaimed Puck.
“You have no sense of humor, dear girl. What do <i>you</i> do that’s
useful?”</p>

<p>Little Maya went red all over, but quickly collected herself to hide
her embarrassment from Puck.</p>

<p>“The time is coming,” she flashed, “when I shall do something big and
splendid, and good and useful too. But first I want to see what is going
on in the world. Deep down in my heart I feel that the time is
coming.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<p>As Maya spoke she felt a hot tide of hope and enthusiasm flood her
being.</p>

<p>Puck seemed not to realize how serious she was, and how deeply
stirred. He zigzagged about in his flurried way for a while, then
asked:</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to have any honey with you, do you, my dear?”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” replied Maya. “I’d gladly let you have some,
especially after you’ve entertained me so pleasantly, but I really
haven’t got any with me.&mdash;May I ask you one more question?”</p>

<p>“Shoot,” said Puck. “I’ll answer, I’ll always answer.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how I could get into a human being’s house.”</p>

<p>“Fly in,” said Puck sagaciously.</p>

<p>“But how, without running into danger?”</p>

<p>“Wait until a window is opened. But be sure to find the way out
again. Once you’re inside, if you can’t find the window, the best thing
to do is to fly toward the light. You’ll always find plenty of windows
in every house. You need only notice where the
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
sun shines through. Are you going already?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Maya, holding out her hand. “I have some things to
attend to. Good-by. I&nbsp;hope you quite recover from the effects of
the ice age.”</p>

<p>And with her fine confident buzz that yet sounded slightly anxious,
little Maya raised her gleaming wings and flew out into the sunshine
across to the flowery meadows to cull a little nourishment.</p>

<p>Puck looked after her, and carefully meditated what might still be
said. Then he observed thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“Well, now. Well, well.&mdash;Why not?”</p>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">IN THE TOILS</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">After</span>
her meeting with Puck the fly Maya was not in a particularly happy frame
of mind. She could not bring herself to believe that he was right in
everything he had said about human beings, or right in his relations to
them. She had formed an entirely different conception&mdash;a much
finer, lovelier picture, and she fought against letting her mind harbor
low or ridiculous ideas of mankind. Yet she was still afraid to enter a
human dwelling. How was she to know whether or not the owner would like
it? And she wouldn’t for all the world make herself a burden to
anyone.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<p>Her thoughts went back once more to the things Cassandra had told
her.</p>

<p>“They are good and wise,” Cassandra had said. “They are strong and
powerful, but they never abuse their power. On the contrary, wherever
they go they bring order and prosperity. We bees, knowing they are
friendly to us, put ourselves under their protection and share our honey
with them. They leave us enough for the winter, they provide us with
shelter against the cold, and guard us against the hosts of our enemies
among the animals. There are few creatures in the world who have entered
into such a relation of friendship and voluntary service with human
beings. Among the insects you will often hear voices raised to speak
evil of man. Don’t listen to them. If a foolish tribe of bees ever
returns to the wild and tries to do without human beings, it soon
perishes. There are too many beasts that hanker for our honey, and often
a whole bee-city&mdash;all its buildings, all its inhabitants&mdash;has
been ruthlessly destroyed, merely because a senseless animal wanted to
satisfy its greed for honey.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<p>That is what Cassandra had told Maya about human beings, and until
Maya had convinced herself of the contrary, she wanted to keep this
belief in them.</p>

<p>It was now afternoon. The sun was dropping behind the fruit trees in
a large vegetable garden through which Maya was flying. The trees were
long past flowering, but the little bee still remembered them in the
shining glory of countless blossoms, whiter than light, lovely, pure,
and exquisite against the blue of the heavens. The delicious perfume,
the gleam and the shimmer&mdash;oh, she’d never forget the rapture of it
as long as she lived.</p>

<p>As she flew she thought of how all that beauty would come again, and
her heart expanded with delight in the glory of the great world in which
she was permitted to live.</p>

<p>At the end of the garden shone the starry tufts of the
jasmine&mdash;delicate yellow faces set in a wreath of pure
white&mdash;sweet perfume wafted to Maya on the soft wings of the
breeze.</p>

<p>And weren’t there still some trees in bloom? Wasn’t it the season for
lindens? Maya
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
thought delightedly of the big serious lindens, whose tops held the red
glow of the setting sun to the very last.</p>

<p>She flew in among the stems of the blackberry vines, which were
putting forth green berries and yielding blossoms at the same time. As
she mounted again to reach the jasmine, something strange to the touch
suddenly laid itself across her forehead and shoulders, and just as
quickly covered her wings. It was the queerest sensation, as if her
wings were crippled and she were suddenly restrained in her flight, and
were falling, helplessly falling. A&nbsp;secret, wicked force seemed to
be holding her feelers, her legs, her wings in invisible captivity. But
she did not fall. Though she could no longer move her wings, she still
hung in the air rocking, caught by a marvelously yielding softness and
delicacy, raised a little, lowered a little, tossed here, tossed there,
like a loose leaf in a faint breeze.</p>

<p>Maya was troubled, but not as yet actually terrified. Why should she
be? There was no pain nor real discomfort of any sort. Simply that it
was so peculiar, so very peculiar,
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
and something bad seemed to be lurking in the background. She must get
on. If she tried very hard, she could, assuredly.</p>

<p>But now she saw a thread across her breast, an elastic silvery thread
finer than the finest silk. She clutched at it quickly, in a cold wave
of terror. It clung to her hand; it wouldn’t shake off. And there ran
another silver thread over her shoulders. It drew itself across her
wings and tied them together&mdash;her wings were powerless. And there,
and there! Everywhere in the air and above her body&mdash;those bright,
glittering, gluey threads!</p>

<p>Maya screamed with horror. Now she knew! Oh&mdash;oh, now she knew!
She was in a spider’s web.</p>

<p>Her terrified shrieks rang out in the silent dome of the summer day,
where the sunshine touched the green of the leaves into gold, and
insects flitted to and fro, and birds swooped gaily from tree to tree.
Nearby, the jasmine sent its perfume into the air&mdash;the jasmine she
had wanted to reach. Now all was over.</p>

<p>A small bluish butterfly, with brown dots
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
gleaming like copper on its wings, came flying very close.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor soul,” it cried, hearing Maya’s screams and seeing her
desperate plight. “May your death be an easy one, lovely child.
I&nbsp;cannot help you. Some day, perhaps this very night, I&nbsp;shall
meet with the same fate. But meanwhile life is still lovely for me.
Good-by. Don’t forget the sunshine in the deep sleep of death.”</p>

<p>And the blue butterfly rocked away, drugged by the sunshine and the
flowers and its own joy of living.</p>

<p>The tears streamed from Maya’s eyes; she lost her last shred of
self-control. She tossed her captive body to and fro, and buzzed as loud
as she could, and screamed for help&mdash;from whom she did not know.
But the more she tossed the tighter she enmeshed herself in the web.
Now, in her great agony, Cassandra’s warnings went through her mind:</p>

<p>“Beware of the spider and its web. If we bees fall into the spider’s
power we suffer the most gruesome death. The spider is heartless
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
and tricky, and once it has a person in its toils, it never lets
him&nbsp;go.”</p>

<p>In a great flare of mortal terror Maya made one huge desperate
effort. Somewhere one of the long, heavier suspension threads snapped.
Maya felt it break, yet at the same time she sensed the awful doom of
the cobweb. This was, that the more one struggled in it, the more
effectively and dangerously it worked. She gave up, in complete
exhaustion.</p>

<p>At that moment she saw the spider herself&mdash;very near, under a
blackberry leaf. At sight of the great monster, silent and serious,
crouching there as if ready to pounce, Maya’s horror was indescribable.
The wicked shining eyes were fastened on the little bee in sinister,
cold-blooded patience.</p>

<p>Maya gave one loud shriek. This was the worst agony of all. Death
itself could look no worse than that grey, hairy monster with her mean
fangs and the raised legs supporting her fat body like a scaffolding.
She would come rushing upon her, and then all would be over.</p>

<p>Now a dreadful fury of anger came upon
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
Maya, such as she had never felt before. Forgetting her great agony,
intent only upon one thing&mdash;selling her life as dearly as
possible&mdash;she uttered her clear, alarming battle-cry, which all
beasts knew and dreaded.</p>

<p>“You will pay for your cunning with death,” she shouted at the
spider. “Just come and try to kill me, you’ll find out what a bee
can&nbsp;do.”</p>

<p>The spider did not budge. She really was uncanny and must have
terrified bigger creatures than little Maya.</p>

<p>Strong in her anger, Maya now made another violent, desperate effort.
Snap! One of the long suspension threads above her broke. The web was
probably meant for flies and gnats, not for such large insects as
bees.</p>

<p>But Maya got herself only more entangled.</p>

<p>In one gliding motion the spider drew quite close to Maya. She swung
by her nimble legs upon a single thread with her body hanging straight
downward.</p>

<p>“What right have you to break my net?” she rasped at Maya. “What are
you doing here? Isn’t the world big enough for you?
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
Why do you disturb a peaceful recluse?”</p>

<p>That was not what Maya had expected to hear. Most certainly not.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” she cried, quivering with glad hope. Ugly as the
spider was, still she did not seem to intend any harm. “I didn’t see
your web and I got tangled in it. I’m so sorry. Please
pardon&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>The spider drew nearer.</p>

<p>“You’re a funny little body,” she said, letting go of the thread
first with one leg, then with the other. The delicate thread shook. How
wonderful that it could support the great creature.</p>

<p>“Oh, do help me out of this,” begged Maya, “I should be so
grateful.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I came here for,” said the spider, and smiled strangely.
For all her smiling she looked mean and deceitful. “Your tossing and
tugging spoils the whole web. Keep quiet one second, and I will set you
free.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks! Ever so many thanks!” cried Maya.</p>

<p>The spider was now right beside her. She
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
examined the web carefully to see how securely Maya was entangled.</p>

<p>“How about your sting?” she asked.</p>

<p>Ugh, how mean and horrid she looked! Maya fairly shivered with
disgust at the thought that she was going to touch her, but replied as
pleasantly as she could:</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble about my sting. I will draw it in, and nobody can hurt
himself on it then.”</p>

<p>“I should hope not,” said the spider. “Now, then, look out! Keep
quiet. Too bad for my web.”</p>

<p>Maya remained still. Suddenly she felt herself being whirled round
and round on the same spot, till she got dizzy and sick and had to close
her eyes.&mdash;But what was that? She opened her eyes quickly. Horrors!
She was completely enmeshed in a fresh sticky thread which the spider
must have had with her.</p>

<p>“My God!” cried little Maya softly, in a quivering voice. That was
all she said. Now she saw how tricky the spider had been; now she was
really caught beyond release; now there was absolutely no chance of
escape. She
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
could no longer move any part of her body. The end was near.</p>

<p>Her fury of anger was gone, there was only a great sadness in her
heart.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was such meanness and wickedness in the world,”
she thought. “The deep night of death is upon me. Good-by, dear bright
sun. Good-by, my dear friend-bees. Why did I leave you? A&nbsp;happy
life to you. I&nbsp;must die.”</p>

<p>The spider sat wary, a little to one side. She was still afraid of
Maya’s sting.</p>

<p>“Well?” she jeered. “How are you feeling, little girl?”</p>

<p>Maya was too proud to answer the false creature. She merely said,
after a while when she felt she couldn’t bear any more:</p>

<p>“Please kill me right away.”</p>

<p>“Really!” said the spider, tying a few torn threads together.
“Really! Do you take me to be as big a dunce as yourself? You’re going
to die anyhow, if you’re kept hanging long enough, and that’s the time
for me to suck the blood out of you&mdash;when you can’t sting. Too bad,
though, that you can’t see how dreadfully
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
you’ve damaged my lovely web. Then you’d realize that you deserve to
die.”</p>

<p>She dropped down to the ground, laid the end of the newly spun thread
about a stone, and pulled it in tight. Then she ran up again, caught
hold of the thread by which little enmeshed Maya hung, and dragged her
captive along.</p>

<p>“You’re going into the shade, my dear,” she said, “so that you shall
not dry up out here in the sunshine. Besides, hanging here you’re like a
scarecrow, you’ll frighten away other nice little mortals who don’t
watch where they’re going. And sometimes the sparrows come and rob my
web.&mdash;To let you know with whom you’re dealing, my name is Thekla,
of the family of cross-spiders. You needn’t tell me your name. It makes
no difference. You’re a fat bit, and you’ll taste just as tender and
juicy by any name.”</p>

<p>So little Maya hung in the shade of the blackberry vine, close to the
ground, completely at the mercy of the cruel spider, who intended her to
die by slow starvation. Hanging with her little head downward&mdash;a
fearful
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
position to be in&mdash;she soon felt she would not last many more
minutes. She whimpered softly, and her cries for help grew feebler and
feebler. Who was there to hear? Her folk at home knew nothing of this
catastrophe, so <i>they</i> couldn’t come hurrying to her rescue.</p>

<p>Suddenly down, in the grass, she heard some one growling:</p>

<p>“Make way! <i>I’m</i> coming.”</p>

<p>Maya’s agonized heart began to beat stormily. She recognized the
voice of Bobbie, the dung-beetle.</p>

<p>“Bobbie,” she called, as loud as she could, “Bobbie, dear
Bobbie!”</p>

<p>“Make way! <i>I’m</i> coming.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not in your way, Bobbie,” cried Maya. “Oh dear, I’m hanging
over your head. The spider has caught&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Bobbie. “So many people know me. You know they
do, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am Maya&mdash;Maya, the bee. Oh please, please help me!”</p>

<p>“Maya? Maya?&mdash;Ah, now I remember. You made my acquaintance
several weeks ago.&mdash;The
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
deuce! You <i>are</i> in a bad way, if I must say so myself. You
certainly do need my help. As I happen to have a few moments’ time,
I&nbsp;won’t refuse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bobbie, can you tear these threads?”</p>

<p>“Tear those threads! Do you mean to insult me?” Bobbie slapped the
muscles of his arm. “Look, little girl. Hard as steel. No match for
<i>that</i> in strength. I&nbsp;can do more than smash a few cobwebs.
You’ll see something that’ll make you open your eyes.”</p>

<p>Bobbie crawled up on the leaf, caught hold of the thread by which
Maya was hanging, clung to it, then let go of the leaf. The thread
broke, and they both fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“That’s only the beginning,” said Bobbie.&mdash;“But Maya, you’re
trembling. My dear child, you poor little girl, how pale you are! Now
who would be so afraid of death? You must look death calmly in the face
as I do. So. I’ll unwrap you now.”</p>

<p>Maya could not utter a syllable. Bright tears of joy ran down her
cheeks. She was to be free again, fly again in the sunshine, wherever
she wished. She was to live.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

</p>

<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<p>But then she saw the spider coming down the blackberry vine.</p>

<p>“Bobbie,” she screamed, “the spider’s coming.”</p>

<p>Bobbie went on unperturbed, merely laughing to himself. He really was
an extraordinarily strong insect.</p>

<p>“She’ll think twice before she comes nearer,” he said.</p>

<p>But there! The vile voice rasped above them:</p>

<p>“Robbers! Help! I’m being robbed. You fat lump, what are you doing
with my prey?”</p>

<p>“Don’t excite yourself, madam,” said Bobbie. “I have a right, haven’t
I, to talk to my friend. If you say another word to displease me, I’ll
tear your whole web to shreds. Well? Why so silent all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>“I am defeated,” said the spider.</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with the case,” observed Bobbie. “Now you’d
better be getting away from here.”</p>

<p>The spider cast a look at Bobbie full of hate and venom; but glancing
up at her web she reconsidered, and turned away slowly, furious,
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
scolding and growling under her breath. Fangs and stings were of no
avail. They wouldn’t even leave a mark on armor such as Bobbie wore.
With violent denunciations against the injustice in the world, the
spider hid herself away inside a withered leaf, from which she could spy
out and watch over her web.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bobbie finished the unwrapping of Maya. He tore the network
and released her legs and wings. The rest she could do herself. She
preened herself happily. But she had to go slow, because she was still
weak from fright.</p>

<p>“You must forget what you have been through,” said Bobbie. “Then
you’ll stop trembling. Now see if you can fly. Try.”</p>

<p>Maya lifted herself with a little buzz. Her wings worked splendidly,
and to her intense joy she felt that no part of her body had been
injured. She flew slowly up to the jasmine flowers, drank avidly of
their abundant scented honey-juice, and returned to Bobbie, who had left
the blackberry vines and was sitting in the grass.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<p>“I thank you with my whole heart and soul,” said Maya, deeply moved
and happy in her regained freedom.</p>

<p>“Thanks are in place,” observed Bobbie. “But that’s the way I always
am&mdash;always doing something for other people. Now fly away. I’d
advise you to lay your head on your pillow early to-night. Have you far
to&nbsp;go?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Maya. “Only a short way. I live at the edge of the
beech-woods. Good-by, Bobbie, I’ll never forget you, never, never, so
long as I live. Good-by.”</p>

CHAPTER VIII</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE BUG AND THE BUTTERFLY</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Her</span>
adventure with the spider gave Maya something to think about. She made
up her mind to be more cautious in the future, not to rush into things
so recklessly. Cassandra’s prudent warnings about the greatest dangers
that threaten the bees, were enough to give one pause; and there were
all sorts of other possibilities, and the world was such a big
place&mdash;oh, there was a good deal to make a little bee stop and
think.</p>

<p>It was in the evening particularly, when twilight fell and the little
bee was all by herself, that one consideration after another stirred her
mind. But the next morning, if the
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
sun shone, she usually forgot half the things that had bothered her the
night before, and allowed her eagerness for experiences to drive her out
again into the gay whirl of life.</p>

<p>One day she met a very curious creature. It was angular and flat as a
pancake, but had a rather neat design on its sheath; and whether its
sheath were wings or what, you couldn’t really tell. The odd little
monster sat absolutely still on the shaded leaf of a raspberry bush, its
eyes half closed, apparently sunk in meditation. The scent of the
raspberries spread around it deliciously. Maya wanted to find out what
sort of an animal it was. She flew to the next-door leaf and said
how-do-you-do. The stranger made no reply.</p>

<p>“How do you do, again?” And Maya gave its leaf a little tap. The flat
object peeled one eye open, turned it on Maya, and said:</p>

<p>“A bee. The world is full of bees,” and closed its eye again.</p>

<p>“Unique,” thought Maya, and determined to get at the stranger’s
secret. For now it excited her curiosity more than ever, as people often
do who pay no attention to us. She tried
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
honey. “I have plenty of honey,” she said. “May I offer you some?” The
stranger opened its one eye and regarded Maya contemplatively a moment
or two. “What is it going to say this time?” Maya wondered.</p>

<p>This time there was no answer at all. The one eye merely closed
again, and the stranger sat quite still, tight on the leaf, so that you
couldn’t see its legs and you’d have thought it had been pressed down
flat with a thumb.</p>

<p>Maya realized, of course, that the stranger wanted to ignore her,
but&mdash;you know how it is&mdash;you don’t like being snubbed,
especially if you haven’t found out what you wanted to find out. It
makes you feel so cheap.</p>

<p>“Whoever you are,” cried Maya, “permit me to inform you that insects
are in the habit of greeting each other, especially when one of them
happens to be a bee.” The bug sat on without budging. It did not so much
as open its one eye again. “It’s ill,” thought Maya. “How horrid to be
ill on a lovely day like this. That’s why it’s staying in the shade,
too.” She flew over to the bug’s leaf and sat
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
down beside it. “Aren’t you feeling well?” she asked, so very
friendly.</p>

<p>At this the funny creature began to move away. “Move” is the only
word to use, because it didn’t walk, or run, or fly, or hop. It went as
if shoved by an invisible hand.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t any legs. That’s why it’s so cross,” thought Maya.</p>

<p>When it reached the stem of the leaf it stopped a second, moved on
again, and, to her astonishment, Maya saw that it had left behind a
little brown drop.</p>

<p>“How <i>very</i> singular,” she thought&mdash;and clapped her hand to
her nose and held it tight shut. The veriest stench came from the little
brown drop. Maya almost fainted. She flew away as fast as she could and
seated herself on a raspberry, where she held on to her nose and
shivered with disgust and excitement.</p>

<p>“Serves you right,” someone above her called, and laughed. “Why take
up with a stink-bug?”</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh!” cried Maya.</p>

<p>She looked up. A white butterfly had alighted overhead on a slender,
swaying branch
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
of the raspberry bush, and was slowly opening and closing its broad
wings&mdash;slowly, softly, silently, happy in the sunshine&mdash;black
corners to its wings, round black marks in the centre of each wing, four
round black marks in all. Ah, how beautiful, how beautiful! Maya forgot
her vexation. And she was glad, too, to talk to the butterfly. She had
never made the acquaintance of one before even though she had met a
great many.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, “you probably are right to laugh. Was that a
stink-bug?”</p>

<p>“It was,” he replied, still smiling. “The sort of person to keep away
from. You’re probably very young still?”</p>

<p>“Well,” observed Maya, “I shouldn’t say I was&mdash;exactly. I’ve
been through a great deal. But that was the first specimen of the kind I
had ever come across. Can you imagine doing such a thing?”</p>

<p>The butterfly had to laugh again.</p>

<p>“You see,” he explained, “stink-bugs like to keep to themselves. They
are not very popular, so they use the odoriferous drop to make people
take notice of them. We’d probably
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
soon forget the fact of their existence if it were not for the drop: it
serves as a reminder. And they want to be remembered, no matter
how.”</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic112.png" width = "247" height = "203"
alt = "Maya talks with the butterfly">
</p>

<p>“How lovely, how exquisitely lovely your wings are,” said Maya. “So
delicate and white. May I introduce myself? Maya, of the nation of
bees.”</p>

<p>The butterfly laid his wings together to look like only one wing
standing straight up in the air. He gave a slight bow.</p>

<p>“Fred,” he said laconically.</p>

<p>Maya couldn’t gaze her fill.</p>

<p>“Fly a little,” she asked.</p>

<p>“Shall I fly away?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. I just want to see your great white wings move in the blue
air. But never mind. I&nbsp;can wait till later. Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere specially. A settled home is too much of a nuisance. Life
didn’t get to be really delightful until I turned into a butterfly.
Before that, while I was still a caterpillar, I&nbsp;couldn’t leave the
cabbage the livelong day, and all one did was eat and squabble.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean?” asked Maya, mystified.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<p>“I used to be a caterpillar,” explained Fred.</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Maya.</p>

<p>“Now, now, now,” said Fred, pointing both feelers straight at Maya.
“Everyone knows a butterfly is first a caterpillar. Even human beings
know&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>Maya was utterly perplexed. Could such a thing be?</p>

<p>“You must really explain more clearly,” she said. “I couldn’t accept
what you say just so, could I? You wouldn’t expect me&nbsp;to.”</p>

<p>The butterfly perched beside the little bee on the slender swaying
branch of the raspberry bush, and they rocked together in the morning
wind. He told her how he had begun life as a caterpillar and then, one
day, when he had shed his last caterpillar skin, he came out a pupa or
chrysalis.</p>

<p>“At the end of a few weeks,” he continued, “I woke up out of my dark
sleep and broke through the wrappings or pupa-case. I&nbsp;can’t tell
you, Maya, what a feeling comes over you when, after a time like that,
you suddenly see the sun again. I&nbsp;felt as though I were melting in
a warm golden ocean, and I loved my
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
life so that my heart began to pound.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Maya, “I understand. I felt the same way the
first time I left our humdrum city and flew out into the bright scented
world of blossoms.” The little bee was silent a while, thinking of her
first flight.&mdash;But then she wanted to know how the butterfly’s
large wings could grow in the small space of the pupa-case.</p>

<p>Fred explained.</p>

<p>“The wings are delicately folded together like the petals of a flower
in the bud. When the weather is bright and warm, the flower must open,
it cannot help itself, and its petals unfold. So with my wings, they
were folded up, then unfolded. No one can resist the sun when it
shines.”</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;one cannot&mdash;one cannot resist the sunshine.” Maya
mused, watching the butterfly as he perched in the golden light of the
morning, pure white against the blue sky.</p>

<p>“People often charge us with being frivolous,” said Fred. “We’re
really happy&mdash;just that&mdash;just happy. You wouldn’t believe how
seriously I sometimes think about life.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<p>“Tell me what all you think.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Fred, “I think about the future. It’s very interesting to
think about the future.&mdash;But I should like to fly now. The meadows
on the hillside are full of yarrow and canterbury bells; everything’s in
bloom. I’d like to be there, you know.”</p>

<p>This Maya understood, she understood it well, and they said good-by
and flew away in different directions, the white butterfly rocking
silently as if wafted by the gentle wind, little Maya with that uneasy
zoom-zoom of the bees which we hear upon the flowers on fair days and
which we always recall when we think of the summer.</p>

CHAPTER IX</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE LOST LEG</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Near</span>
the hole where Maya had set herself up for the summer lived a family of
bark-boring beetles. Fridolin, the father, was an earnest, industrious
man who wanted many children and took immense pains to bring up a large
family. He had done very well: he had fifty energetic sons to fill him
with pride and high hopes. Each had dug his own meandering little tunnel
in the bark of the pine-tree and all were getting on and were
comfortably settled.</p>

<p>“My wife,” Fridolin said to Maya, after they had known each other
some time,
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
“has arranged things so that none of my sons interferes with the others.
They are not even acquainted; each goes his own way.”</p>

<p>Maya knew that human beings were none too fond of Fridolin and his
people, though she herself liked him and liked his opinions and had
found no reason to avoid him. In the morning before the sun arose and
the woods were still asleep, she would hear his fine tapping and boring.
It sounded like a delicate trickling, or as if the tree were breathing
in its sleep. Later she would see the thin brown dust that he had
emptied out of his corridor.</p>

<p>Once he came at an early hour, as he often did, to wish her
good-morning and ask if she had slept well.</p>

<p>“Not flying to-day?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No, it’s too windy.”</p>

<p>It was windy. The wind rushed and roared and flung the branches into
a mad tumult. The leaves looked ready to fly away. After each great gust
the sky would brighten, and in the pale light the trees seemed balder.
The pine in which Maya and Fridolin lived shrieked
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
with the voices of the wind as in a fury of anger and excitement.</p>

<p>Fridolin sighed.</p>

<p>“I worked all night,” he told Maya, “all night. But what can you do?
You’ve got to do <i>some</i>thing to get <i>some</i>where. And I’m not
altogether satisfied with this pine; I&nbsp;should have tackled a
fir-tree.” He wiped his brow and smiled in self-pity.</p>

<p>“How are your children?” asked Maya pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Fridolin, “thank you for your interest.
But”&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;“but I don’t supervise the way I used to.
Still, I&nbsp;have reason to believe they are all doing well.”</p>

<p>As he sat there, a little brown man with slightly curtailed
wing-sheaths and a breastplate that looked like a head too large for its
body, Maya thought he was almost comical; but she knew he was a
dangerous beetle who could do immense harm to the mighty trees of the
forest, and if his tribe attacked a tree in numbers then the green
needles were doomed, the tree would turn <ins class = "correction" title
= "spelling unchanged">sear</ins> and die. It was utterly
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
without defenses against the little marauders who destroyed the bark and
the sap-wood. And the sap-wood is necessary to the life of a tree
because it carries the sap up to the very tips of the branches. There
were stories of how whole forests had fallen victims to the race of
boring-beetles. Maya looked at Fridolin reflectively; she was awed into
solemnity at the thought of the great power these little creatures
possessed and of how important they could become.</p>

<p>Fridolin sighed and said in a worried tone:</p>

<p>“Ah, life would be beautiful if there were no woodpeckers.”</p>

<p>Maya nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, you’re right. The woodpecker gobbles up every insect he
sees.”</p>

<p>“If it were only that,” observed Fridolin, “if it were only that he
got the careless people who fool around on the outside, on the bark, I’d
say, ‘Very well, a&nbsp;woodpecker must live too.’ But it seems all
wrong that the bird should follow us right into our corridors into the
remotest corners of our homes.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t. He’s too big, isn’t he?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<p>Fridolin looked at Maya with an air of grave importance, lifting his
brows and shaking his head two or three times. It seemed to please him
that he knew something she didn’t know.</p>

<p>“Too big? What difference does his size make? No, my dear, it’s not
his size we are afraid of; it’s his tongue.”</p>

<p>Maya made big eyes.</p>

<p>Fridolin told her about the woodpecker’s tongue: that it was long and
thin, and round as a worm, and barbed and sticky.</p>

<p>“He can stretch his tongue out ten times my length,” cried the
bark-beetle, flourishing his arm. “You think: ‘now&mdash;now he has
reached the limit, he can’t make it the tiniest bit longer.’ But no, he
goes on stretching and stretching it. He pokes it deep into all the
cracks and crevices of the bark, on the chance that he’ll find somebody
sitting there. He even pushes it into our passageways&mdash;actually,
into our corridors and chambers. Things stick to it, and that’s the way
he pulls us out of our homes.”</p>

<p>“I am not a coward,” said Maya, “I don’t
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
think I am, but what you say makes me creepy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>you’re</i> all right,” said Fridolin, a little envious, “you
with your sting are safe. A&nbsp;person’ll think twice before he’ll let
you sting his tongue. Anybody’ll tell you that. But how about us
bark-beetles? How do you think we feel? A&nbsp;cousin of mine got
caught. We had just had a little quarrel on account of my wife.
I&nbsp;remember every detail perfectly. My cousin was paying us a visit
and hadn’t yet got used to our ways or our arrangements. All of a sudden
we heard a woodpecker scratching and boring&mdash;one of the smaller
species. It must have begun right at our building because as a rule we
hear him beforehand and have time to run to shelter before he
reaches&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>“Suddenly I heard my poor cousin scream in the dark: ‘Fridolin, I’m
sticking!’ Then all I heard was a short desperate scuffle, followed by
complete silence, and in a few moments the woodpecker was hammering at
the house next door. My poor cousin! Her name was Agatha.”</p>

<p>“Feel how my heart is beating,” said Maya,
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
in a whisper. “You oughtn’t to have told it so quickly. My goodness, the
things that do happen!” And the little bee thought of her own adventures
in the past and the accidents that might still happen to her.</p>

<p>A laugh from Fridolin interrupted her reflections. She looked up in
surprise.</p>

<p>“See who’s coming,” he cried, “coming up the tree. Here’s the fellow
for you! I&nbsp;tell you, he’s a&mdash;but you’ll see.”</p>

<p>Maya followed the direction of his gaze and saw a remarkable animal
slowly climbing up the trunk. She wouldn’t have believed such a creature
was possible if she had not seen it with her own eyes.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better hide?” she asked, alarm getting the better of
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Absurd,” replied the bark-beetle, “just sit still and be polite to
the gentleman. He is very learned, really, very scholarly, and what is
more, kind and modest and, like most persons of his type, rather funny.
See what he’s doing now!”</p>

<p>“Probably thinking,” observed Maya, who couldn’t get over her
astonishment.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<p>“He’s struggling against the wind,” said Fridolin, and laughed. “I
hope his legs don’t get entangled.”</p>

<p>“Are those long threads really his legs?” asked Maya, opening her
eyes wide. “I’ve never seen the like.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the newcomer had drawn near, and Maya got a better view of
him. He looked as though he were swinging in the air, his rotund little
body hung so high on his monstrously long legs, which groped for a
footing on all sides like a movable scaffolding of threads. He stepped
along cautiously, feeling his way; the little brown sphere of his body
rose and sank, rose and sank. His legs were so very long and thin that
one alone would certainly not have been enough to support his body. He
needed all at once, unquestionably. As they were jointed in the middle,
they rose high in the air above him.</p>

<p>Maya clapped her hands together.</p>

<p>“Well!” she cried. “Did you ever? Would you have dreamed that such
delicate legs, legs as fine as a hair, could be so nimble and
useful&mdash;that one could really use them&mdash;and
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
they’d know what to do? Fridolin, I&nbsp;think it’s wonderful, simply
wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Ah, bah,” said the bark-beetle. “Don’t take things so seriously.
Just laugh when you see something funny; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t feel like laughing. Often we laugh at something and
later find out it was just because we haven’t understood.”</p>

<p>By this time the stranger had joined them and was looking down at
Maya from the height of his pointed triangles of legs.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” he said, “a real wind-storm&mdash;a pretty strong
draught, don’t you think, or&mdash;no? You are of a different opinion?”
He clung to the tree as hard as he could.</p>

<p>Fridolin turned to hide his laughing, but little Maya replied
politely that she quite agreed with him and that was why she had not
gone out flying. Then she introduced herself. The stranger squinted down
at her through his legs.</p>

<p>“Maya, of the nation of bees,” he repeated. “Delighted, really.
I&nbsp;have heard a good deal about bees.&mdash;I myself belong to the
general
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
family of spiders, species daddy-long-legs, and my name is
Hannibal.”</p>

<p>The word spider has an evil sound in the ears of all smaller insects,
and Maya could not quite conceal her fright, especially as she was
reminded of her agony in Thekla’s web. Hannibal seemed to take no
notice, so Maya decided, “Well if need be I’ll fly away, and he can
whistle for me; he has no wings and his web is somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking,” said Hannibal, “thinking very hard.&mdash;If you
will permit me, I&nbsp;will come a little closer. That big branch there
makes a good shield against the wind.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” said Maya, making room for him.</p>

<p>Fridolin said good-by and left. Maya stayed; she was eager to get at
Hannibal’s personality.</p>

<p>“The many, many different kinds of animals there are in the world,”
she thought. “Every day a fresh discovery.”</p>

<p>The wind had subsided some, and the sun shone through the branches.
From below rose the song of a robin redbreast, filling the
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
woods with joy. Maya could see it perched on a branch, could see its
throat swell and pulse with the song as it held its little head raised
up to the light.</p>

<p>“If only I could sing like that robin redbreast,” she said, “I’d
perch on a flower and keep it up the livelong day.”</p>

<p>“You’d produce something lovely, you would, with your humming and
buzzing.”</p>

<p>“The bird looks so happy.”</p>

<p>“You have great fancies,” said the daddy-long-legs. “Supposing every
animal were to wish he could do something that nature had not fitted him
to do, the world would be all topsy-turvy. Supposing a robin redbreast
thought he had to have a sting&mdash;a sting above everything
else&mdash;or a goat wanted to fly about gathering honey. Supposing a
frog were to come along and languish for my kind of legs.”</p>

<p>Maya laughed.</p>

<p>“That isn’t just what I mean. I mean, it seems lovely to be able to
make all beings as happy as the bird does with his song.&mdash;But
goodness gracious!” she exclaimed suddenly. “Mr. Hannibal, you have one
leg too many.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<p>Hannibal frowned and looked into space, vexed.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve noticed it,” he said glumly. “But as a matter of
fact&mdash;one leg too few, not too many.”</p>

<p>“Why? Do you usually have eight legs?”</p>

<p>“Permit me to explain. We spiders have eight legs. We need them all.
Besides, eight is a more aristocratic number. One of my legs got lost.
Too bad about it. However you manage, you make the best of&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>“It must be dreadfully disagreeable to lose a leg,” Maya
sympathized.</p>

<p>Hannibal propped his chin on his hand and arranged his legs to keep
them from being easily counted.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how it happened. Of course, as usual when there’s
mischief, a&nbsp;human being is mixed up in it. We spiders are careful
and look what we’re doing, but human beings are careless, they grab you
sometimes as though you were a piece of wood. Shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do please,” said Maya, settling herself comfortably. “It would
be awfully interesting.
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
You must certainly have gone through a good deal.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” said Hannibal. “Now listen. We daddy-long-legs,
you know, hunt by night. I&nbsp;was then living in a green garden-house.
It was overgrown with ivy, and there were a number of broken
window-panes, which made it very convenient for me to crawl in and out.
The man came at dark. In one hand he carried his artificial sun, which
he calls lamp, in the other hand a small bottle, under his arm some
paper, and in his pocket another bottle. He put everything down on the
table and began to think, because he wanted to write his thoughts on the
paper.&mdash;You must certainly have come across paper in the woods or
in the garden. The black on the paper is what man has
excogitated&mdash;excogitated.”</p>

<p>“Marvelous!” cried Maya, all a-glow that she was to learn so
much.</p>

<p>“For this purpose,” Hannibal continued, “man needs both bottles. He
inserts a stick into the one and drinks out of the other. The more he
drinks, the better it goes. Of course
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
it is about us insects that he writes, everything he knows about us, and
he writes strenuously, but the result is not much to boast of, because
up to now man has found out very little in regard to insects. He is
absolutely ignorant of our soul-life and hasn’t the least consideration
for our feelings. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think well of human beings?” asked Maya.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes. But the loss of a leg”&mdash;the daddy-long-legs
looked down slantwise&mdash;“is apt to embitter one, rather.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Maya.</p>

<p>“One evening I was sitting on a window-frame as usual, prepared for
the chase, and the man was sitting at the table, his two bottles before
him, trying to produce something. It annoyed me dreadfully that a whole
swarm of little flies and gnats, upon which I depend for my subsistence,
had settled upon the artificial sun and were staring into it in that
crude, stupid, uneducated way of theirs.”</p>

<p>“Well,” observed Maya, “I think I’d look at a thing like that
myself.”</p>

<p>“Look, for all I care. But to look and to
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
stare like an idiot are two entirely different things. Just watch once
and see the silly jig they dance around a lamp. It’s nothing for them to
butt their heads about twenty times. Some of them keep it up until they
burn their wings. And all the time they stare and stare at the
light.”</p>

<p>“Poor creatures! Evidently they lose their wits.”</p>

<p>“Then they had better stay outside on the window-frame or under the
leaves. They’re safe from the lamp there, and that’s where I can catch
them.&mdash;Well, on that fateful night I saw from my position on the
window-frame that some gnats were lying scattered on the table beside
the lamp drawing their last breath. The man did not seem to notice or
care about them, so I decided to go and take them myself. That’s
perfectly natural, isn’t&nbsp;it?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“And yet, it was my undoing. I crept up the leg of the table, very
softly, on my guard, until I could peep over the edge. The man seemed
dreadfully big. I&nbsp;watched him working.
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
Then, slowly, very slowly, carefully lifting one leg at a time,
I&nbsp;crossed over to the lamp. As long as I was covered by the bottle
all went well, but I had scarcely turned the corner, when the man looked
up and grabbed me. He lifted me by one of my legs, dangled me in front
of his huge eyes, and said: ‘See what’s here, just see what’s here.’ And
he grinned&mdash;the brute!&mdash;he grinned with his whole face, as
though it were a laughing matter.”</p>

<p>Hannibal sighed, and little Maya kept quite still. Her head was in a
whirl.</p>

<p>“Have human beings such immense eyes?” she asked at last.</p>

<p>“Please think of <i>me</i> in the position <i>I</i> was in,” cried
Hannibal, vexed. “Try to imagine how I felt. Who’d like to be hanging by
the leg in front of eyes twenty times as big as his own body and a mouth
full of gleaming teeth, each fully twice as big as himself? Well, what
do you think?”</p>

<p>“Awful! Perfectly awful!”</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord, my leg broke off. There’s no telling what might have
happened if my
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
leg had not broken off. I&nbsp;fell to the table, and then I ran,
I&nbsp;ran as fast as my remaining legs would take me, and hid behind
the bottle. There I stood and hurled threats of violence at the man.
They saved me, my threats did, the man was afraid to run after me.
I&nbsp;saw him lay my leg on the white paper, and I watched how it
wanted to escape&mdash;which it can’t do without&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“Was it still moving?” asked Maya, prickling at the thought.</p>

<p>“Yes. Our legs always do move when they’re pulled out. My leg ran,
but I not being there it didn’t know where to run to, so it merely
flopped about aimlessly on the same spot, and the man watched it,
clutching at his nose and smiling&mdash;smiling, the heartless
wretch!&mdash;at my leg’s sense of duty.”</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic132.png" width = "284" height = "157"
alt = "Maya with Hannibal">
</p>

<p>“Impossible,” said the little bee, quite scared, “an offen leg can’t
crawl.”</p>

<p>“An offen leg? <i>What</i> is an offen leg?”</p>

<p>“A leg that has come off,” explained Maya, staring at him. “Don’t you
know? At home we children used the word offen for anything that had come
off.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<p>“You should drop your nursery slang when you’re out in the world and
in the presence of cultured people,” said Hannibal severely. “But it
<i>is</i> true that our legs totter long after they have been torn from
our bodies.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it without proof.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’ll tear one of my legs off to satisfy you?”
Hannibal’s tone was ugly. “I see you’re not a fit person to associate
with. Nobody, I’d like you to know, <i>no</i>body has ever doubted my
word before.”</p>

<p>Maya was terribly put out. She couldn’t understand what had upset the
daddy-long-legs so, or what dreadful thing she had done.</p>

<p>“It isn’t altogether easy to get along with strangers,” she thought.
“They don’t think the way we do and don’t see that we mean no harm.” She
was depressed and cast a troubled look at the spider with his long legs
and soured expression.</p>

<p>“Really, someone ought to come and eat you up.”</p>

<p>Hannibal had evidently mistaken Maya’s good nature for weakness. For
now something unusual happened to the little bee. Suddenly
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
her depression passed and gave way, not to alarm or timidity, but to a
calm courage. She straightened up, lifted her lovely, transparent wings,
uttered her high clear buzz, and said with a gleam in her eyes:</p>

<p>“I am a bee, Mr. Hannibal.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said he, and without saying good-by turned and
ran down the tree-trunk as fast as a person can run who has seven
legs.</p>

<p>Maya had to laugh, willy-nilly. From down below Hannibal began to
scold.</p>

<p>“You’re bad. You threaten helpless people, you threaten them with
your sting when you know they’re handicapped by a misfortune and can’t
get away fast. But your hour is coming, and when you’re in a tight place
you’ll think of me and be sorry.” Hannibal disappeared under the leaves
of the coltsfoot on the ground. His last words had not reached the
little bee.</p>

<p>The wind had almost died away, and the day promised to be fine. White
clouds sailed aloft in a deep, deep blue, looking happy and serene like
good thoughts of the Lord. Maya
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
was cheered. She thought of the rich shaded meadows by the woods and of
the sunny slopes beyond the lake. A&nbsp;blithe activity must have begun
there by this time. In her mind she saw the slim grasses waving and the
purple iris that grew in the rills at the edge of the woods. From the
flower of an iris you could look across to the mysterious night of the
pine-forest and catch its cool breath of melancholy. You knew that its
forbidding silence, which transformed the sunshine into a reddish
half-light of sleep, was the home of the fairy tale.</p>

<p>Maya was already flying. She had started off instinctively, in answer
to the call of the meadows and their gay carpeting of flowers. It was a
joy to be alive.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">133</span>

CHAPTER X</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE WONDERS OF THE NIGHT</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Thus</span>
the days and weeks of her young life passed for little Maya among the
insects in a lovely summer world&mdash;a happy roving in garden and
meadow, occasional risks and many joys. For all that, she often missed
the companions of her early childhood and now and again suffered a pang
of homesickness, an ache of longing for her people and the kingdom she
had left. There were hours, too, when she yearned for regular, useful
work and association with friends of her own kind.</p>

<p>However, at bottom she had a restless nature, little Maya had, and
was scarcely ready
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
to settle down for good and live in the community of the bees; she
wouldn’t have felt comfortable. Often among animals as well as human
beings there are some who cannot conform to the ways of the others.
Before we condemn them we must be careful and give them a chance to
prove themselves. For it is not always laziness or stubbornness that
makes them different. Far from it. At the back of their peculiar urge is
a deep longing for something higher or better than what every-day life
has to offer, and many a time young runaways have grown up into good,
sensible, experienced men and women.</p>

<p>Little Maya was a pure, sensitive soul, and her attitude to the big,
beautiful world came of a genuine eagerness for knowledge and a great
delight in the glories of creation.</p>

<p>Yet it is hard to be alone even when you are happy, and the more Maya
went through, the greater became her yearning for companionship and
love. She was no longer so very young; she had grown into a strong,
superb creature with sound, bright wings, a&nbsp;sharp, dangerous sting,
and a highly developed sense
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
of both the pleasures and the hazards of her life. Through her own
experience she had gathered information and stored up wisdom, which she
now often wished she could apply to something of real value. There were
days when she was ready to return to the hive and throw herself at the
queen’s feet and sue for pardon and honorable reinstatement. But a
great, burning desire held her back&mdash;the desire to know human
beings. She had heard so many contradictory things about them that she
was confused rather than enlightened. Yet she had a feeling that in the
whole of creation there were no beings more powerful or more intelligent
or more sublime than they.</p>

<p>A few times in her wanderings she had seen people, but only from
afar, from high up in the air&mdash;big and little people, black people,
white people, red people, and such as dressed in many colors. She had
never ventured close. Once she had caught the glimmer of red near a
brook, and thinking it was a bed of flowers had flown down. She found a
human being fast asleep among the brookside blossoms. It had golden hair
and a pink face and wore a
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
red dress. It was dreadfully large, of course, but still it looked so
good and sweet that Maya thrilled, and tears came to her eyes. She lost
all sense of her whereabouts; she could do nothing but gaze and gaze
upon the slumbering presence. All the horrid things she had ever heard
against man seemed utterly impossible. Lies they must have
been&mdash;mean lies that she had been told against creatures as
charming as this one asleep in the shade of the whispering
birch-trees.</p>

<p>After a while a mosquito came and buzzed greetings.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Maya, hot with excitement and delight. “Look, just look
at that human being there. How good, how beautiful! Doesn’t it fill you
with enthusiasm?”</p>

<p>The mosquito gave Maya a surprised stare, then turned slowly round to
glance at the object of her admiration.</p>

<p>“Yes, it <i>is</i> good. I just tasted it. I stung it. Look, my body
is shining red with its blood.”</p>

<p>Maya had to press her hand to her heart, so startled was she by the
mosquito’s daring.</p>

<p>“Will it die?” she cried. “Where did you
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
wound it? How could you? How could you screw up your courage to sting
it? And how vile! Why, you’re a beast of prey!”</p>

<p>The mosquito tittered.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s only a very little human being,” it answered in its high,
thin voice. “It’s the size called girl&mdash;the size at which the legs
are covered half way up with a separate colored casing. My sting, of
course, goes through the casing but usually doesn’t reach the
skin.&mdash;Your ignorance is really stupendous. Do you actually think
that human beings are good? I&nbsp;haven’t come across one who willingly
let me take the tiniest drop of his blood.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know very much about human beings, I admit,” said Maya
humbly.</p>

<p>“But of all the insects you bees have most to do with human beings.
That’s a well-known fact.”</p>

<p>“I left our kingdom,” Maya confessed timidly. “I didn’t like it.
I&nbsp;wanted to learn about the outside world.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, what do you think of that!” The mosquito drew a step
nearer. “How do you like your free-lancing? I&nbsp;must say,
I&nbsp;admire
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
you for your independence. I&nbsp;for one would never consent to serve
human beings.”</p>

<p>“But they serve us too!” said Maya, who couldn’t bear a slight to be
put upon her people.</p>

<p>“Maybe.&mdash;To what nation do you belong?”</p>

<p>“I come of the nation in the castle park. The ruling queen is Helen
VIII.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said the mosquito, and bowed low. “An enviable lineage. My
deepest respects.&mdash;There was a revolution in your kingdom not so
long ago, wasn’t there? I&nbsp;heard it from the messengers of the rebel
swarm. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Maya, proud and happy that her nation was so respected
and renowned. Homesickness for her people awoke again, deep down in her
heart, and she wished she could do something good and great for her
queen and country. Carried away on the wings of this dream, she forgot
to ask about human beings. Or, like as not, she refrained from
questions, feeling that the mosquito would not tell her things she would
be glad to hear. The mite of a creature impressed her as a saucy
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
Miss, and people of her kind usually had nothing good to say of others.
Besides, she soon flew away.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take one more drink,” she called back to Maya. “Later I
and my friends are going flying in the light of the westering sun. Then
we’ll be sure to have good weather to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Maya made off quickly. She couldn’t bear to stay and see the mosquito
hurt the sleeping child. And how could she do this thing and not perish?
Hadn’t Cassandra said: “If you sting a human being, you will die?”</p>

<p>Maya still remembered every detail of this incident with the child
and the mosquito, but her craving to know human beings well had not been
stilled. She made up her mind to be bolder and never stop trying until
she had reached her goal.</p>

<hr class = "mid">

<p>At last Maya’s longing to know human beings was to be satisfied, and
in a way far, far lovelier and more wonderful than she had dreamed.</p>

<p>Once, on a warm evening, having gone to
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
sleep earlier than usual, she woke up suddenly in the middle of the
night&mdash;something that had never happened to her before. When she
opened her eyes, her astonishment was indescribable: her little bedroom
was all steeped in a quiet bluish radiance. It came down through the
entrance, and the entrance itself shone as if hung with a silver-blue
curtain.</p>

<p>Maya did not dare to budge at first, though not because she was
frightened. No. Somehow, along with the light came a rare, lovely
peacefulness, and outside her room the air was filled with a sound
finer, more harmonious than any music she had ever heard. After a time
she rose timidly, awed by the glamour and the strangeness of it all, and
looked out. The whole world seemed to lie under the spell of an
enchantment. Everything was sparkling and glittering in pure silver. The
trunks of the birch-trees, the slumbering leaves were overlaid with
silver. The grass, which from her height seemed to lie under delicate
veils, was set with a thousand pale pearls. All things near and far, the
silent distances, were shrouded in this soft, bluish sheen.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<p>“This must be the night,” Maya whispered and folded her hands.</p>

<p>High up in the heavens, partly veiled by the leaves of a beech-tree,
hung a full clear disk of silver, from which the radiance poured down
that beautified the world. And then Maya saw countless bright, sharp
little lights surrounding the moon in the heavens&mdash;oh, so still and
beautiful, unlike any shining things she had ever seen before. To think
she beheld the night, the moon, and the stars&mdash;the wonders, the
lovely wonders of the night! She had heard of them but never believed in
them. It was almost too much.</p>

<p>Then the sound rose again, the strange night sound that must have
awakened her. It came from nearby, filling the welkin, a&nbsp;soaring
chirp with a silvery ring that matched the silver on the trees and
leaves and grass and seemed to come rilling down from the moon on the
beams of silver light.</p>

<p>Maya looked about for the source, in vain; in the mysterious drift of
light and shadow it was difficult to make out objects in clear outline,
everything was draped so mysteriously;
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
and yet everything showed up true and in such heroic beauty.</p>

<p>Her room could keep her no longer; out she had to fly into this new
splendor, the night splendor.</p>

<p>“The good Lord will take care of me,” she thought, “I am not bent
upon wrong.”</p>

<p>As she was about to fly off through the silver light to her favorite
meadow, now lying full under the moon, she saw a winged creature alight
on a beech-tree leaf not far away. Scarcely alighted, it raised its head
to the moon, lifted its narrow wings, and drew the edge of one against
the other, for all the world as though it were playing on a violin. And
sure enough, the sound came, the silvery chirp that filled the whole
moonlit world with melody<ins class = "correction" title = "text has unneeded close quote">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“Exquisite,” whispered Maya, “heavenly, heavenly, heavenly.”</p>

<p>She flew over to the leaf. The night was so mild and warm that she
did not notice it was cooler than by day. When she touched the leaf, the
chirper broke off playing abruptly, and to Maya it seemed as if there
had never
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
been such a stillness before, so profound was the hush that followed. It
was uncanny. Through the dark leaves filtered the light, white and
cool.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic152.png" width = "289" height = "153"
alt = "Maya talking with the cricket">
</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Maya, politely, thinking “good night” was the
greeting for the night like “good morning” for the morning. “Please
excuse me for interrupting, but the music you make is so fascinating
that I had to find out where it came from.”</p>

<p>The chirper stared at Maya, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>“What sort of a crawling creature are you?” it asked after some
moments had passed. “I have never met one like you before.”</p>

<p>“I am not a crawling insect. I am Maya, of the nation of bees.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of the nation of bees. Indeed ... you live by day, don’t you?
I&nbsp;have heard of your race from the hedgehog. He told me that in the
evening he eats the dead bodies that are thrown out of your hive.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Maya, with a faint chill of apprehension, “that’s so;
Cassandra told me about him; she heard of him from the sentinels. He
comes when twilight falls and
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
snouts in the grass looking for dead bodies.&mdash;But do you associate
with the hedgehog? Why, he’s an awful brute.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. We tree-crickets get along with him splendidly. We
call him Uncle. Of course he always tries to catch us, but he never
succeeds, so we have great fun teasing him. Everybody has to live,
doesn’t he? Just so he doesn’t live off me, what do I care?”</p>

<p>Maya shook her head. She didn’t agree. But not caring to insult the
cricket by contradicting, she changed the subject.</p>

<p>“So you’re a tree-cricket?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a snowy tree-cricket.&mdash;But I must play, so please don’t
keep me any longer. It’s full moon, a&nbsp;wonderful night. I&nbsp;must
play.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do make an exception this once. You play all the
time.&mdash;Tell me about the night.”</p>

<p>“A midsummer night is the loveliest in the world,” answered the
cricket. “It fills the heart with rapture.&mdash;But what my music
doesn’t tell you I shan’t be able to explain. Why <i>need</i> everything
be explained? Why
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<i>know</i> everything? We poor creatures can find out only the tiniest
bit about existence. Yet we can <i>feel</i> the glory of the whole wide
world.” And the cricket set up its happy silvery strumming. Heard from
close by, where Maya sat, the music was overpowering in its
loudness.</p>

<p>The little bee sat quite still in the blue summer night listening and
musing deeply about life and creation.</p>

<p>Silence fell. There was a faint whirr, and Maya saw the cricket fly
out into the moonlight.</p>

<p>“The night makes one feel sad,” she reflected.</p>

<p>Her flowery meadow drew her now. She flew off.</p>

<p>At the edge of the brook stood the tall irises brokenly reflected in
the running water. A&nbsp;glorious sight. The moonlight was whirled
along in the braided current, the wavelets winked and whispered, the
irises seemed to lean over asleep. “Asleep from sheer delight,” thought
the little bee. She dropped down on a blue petal in the full light of
the
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
moon and could not take her eyes from the living waters of the brook,
the quivering flash, the flashing come and go of countless sparks. On
the bank opposite, the birch-trees glittered as if hung with the
stars.</p>

<p>“Where is all that water flowing to?” she wondered. “The cricket is
right. We know so little about the world.”</p>

<p>Of a sudden a fine little voice rose in song from the flower of an
iris close beside her, ringing like a pure, clear bell, different from
any earthly sound that Maya knew. Her heart throbbed, she held her
breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is going to happen? What am I going to see now?”</p>

<p>The iris swayed gently. One of the petals curved in at the edge, and
Maya saw a tiny snow-white human hand holding on to the flower’s rim
with its wee little fingers. Then a small blond head arose, and then a
delicate luminous body in white garments. A&nbsp;human being in
miniature was coming up out of the iris.</p>

A human being in miniature was coming up out of the iris</p>

<p>Words cannot tell Maya’s awe and rapture. She sat rigid.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<p>The tiny being climbed to the edge of the blossom, lifted its arms up
to the moonlight, and looked out into the bright shining night with a
smile of bliss lighting up its face. Then a faint quiver shook its
luminous body, and from its shoulders two wings unfolded, whiter than
the moonlight, pure as snow, rising above its blond head and reaching
down to its feet. How lovely it was, how exquisitely lovely. Nothing
that Maya had ever seen compared with it in loveliness.</p>

<p>Standing there in the moonlight, holding its hands up to heaven, the
luminous little being lifted its voice again and sang. The song rang out
in the night, and Maya understood the words.</p>

<div class = "poem">

<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<p>Maya burst into sobs. What it was that made her so sad and yet so
happy, she could not have told.</p>

<p>The little human being turned around.</p>

<p>“Who is crying?” he asked in his chiming voice.</p>

<p>“It’s only me,” stammered Maya. “Excuse me for interrupting you.”</p>

<p>“But why are you crying?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps just because you are so beautiful. Who are
you? Oh, do tell me, if I am not asking too much. You are an angel,
aren’t you? You must&nbsp;be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the little creature, quite serious. “I am only a
sprite, a&nbsp;flower-sprite.&mdash;But, dear little bee, what are you
doing out here in the meadow so late at night?”</p>

<p>The sprite flew over to a curving iris blade beside Maya and regarded
her long and kindly from his swaying perch in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Maya told him all about herself, what she had done, what she knew,
and what she longed for. And while she spoke, his eyes never left her,
those large dark eyes glowing in the white
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
fairy face under the golden hair that ever and anon shone like silver in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>When she finished he stroked her head and looked at her so warmly and
lovingly that the little bee, beside herself with joy, had to lower her
gaze.</p>

<p>“We sprites,” he explained, “live seven nights, but we must stay in
the flower in which we are born, else we die at dawn.”</p>

<p>Maya opened her eyes wide in terror.</p>

<p>“Then hurry, hurry! Fly back into your flower!”</p>

<p>The, sprite shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Too late.&mdash;But listen. I have more to tell you. Most of us
sprites are glad to leave our flowers never to return, because a great
happiness is connected with our leaving. We are endowed with a
remarkable power: before we die, we can fulfill the dearest wish of the
first creature we meet. It is when we make up our minds seriously to
leave the flower for the purpose of making someone happy that our wings
grow.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful!” cried Maya. “I’d leave the flower too, then. It must
be lovely to fulfill
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
another person’s wish.” That <i>she</i> was the first being whom the
sprite on his flight from the flower had met, did not occur to her. “And
then&mdash;must you die?”</p>

<p>The sprite nodded, but not sadly this time.</p>

<p>“We live to see the dawn still,” he said, “but when the dew falls, we
are drawn into the fine cobwebby veils that float above the grass and
the flowers of the meadows. Haven’t you often noticed that the veils
shine white as though a light were inside them? It’s the sprites, their
wings and their garments. When the light rises we change into dew-drops.
The plants drink us and we become a part of their growing and blooming
until in time we rise again as sprites from out their flowers.”</p>

<p>“Then you were once another sprite?” asked Maya, tense, breathless
with interest.</p>

<p>The earnest eyes said yes.</p>

<p>“But I have forgotten my earlier existence. We forget everything in
our flower-sleep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lovely fate!”</p>

<p>“It is the same as that of all earthly creatures,
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
when you really come to think of it, even if it isn’t always flowers out
of which they wake up from their sleep of death. But we won’t talk of
that to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so happy!” cried Maya.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t got a wish? You’re the first person I’ve met, you
know, and I possess the power to grant your dearest wish.”</p>

<p>“I? But I’m only a bee. No, it’s too much. It would be too great a
joy. I&nbsp;don’t deserve it, I&nbsp;don’t deserve that you should be so
good to&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“No one deserves the good and the beautiful. The good and the
beautiful come to us like the sunshine.”</p>

<p>Maya’s heart beat stormily. Oh, she did have a wish, a burning wish,
but she didn’t dare confess it. The elf seemed to guess; he smiled so
you couldn’t keep anything a secret from him.</p>

<p>“Well?” He stroked his golden hair off his pure forehead.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know human beings at their best and most beautiful,”
said the little bee. She spoke quickly and hotly. She was afraid
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
she would be told that so great a wish could not be granted.</p>

<p>But the sprite drew himself up, his expression was serious and
serene, his eyes shone with confidence. He took Maya’s trembling hand
and said:</p>

<p>“Come. We’ll fly together. Your wish shall be granted.”</p>

CHAPTER XI</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">WITH THE SPRITE</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">And</span>
so Maya and the flower-sprite started off together in the bright
mid-summer night, flying low over the blossomy meadow. His white
reflection crossing the brook shone as though a star were gliding
through the water.</p>

<p>How happy the little bee was to confide herself to this gracious
being! Whatever he were to do, wherever he were to lead her would be
good and right, she felt. She would have liked to ask him a thousand
questions had she dared.</p>

<p>As they were passing between a double row of high poplar-trees,
something whirred
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
above them; a&nbsp;dark moth, as big and strong as a bird, crossed their
way.</p>

<p>“One moment, wait one moment, please,” the sprite called.</p>

<p>Maya was surprised to see how readily the moth responded.</p>

<p>All three alighted on a high poplar branch, from which there was a
far view out upon the tranquil, moonlit landscape. The quaking leaves
whispered delicately. The moth, perching directly opposite Maya in the
full light of the moon, slowly lifted his spread wings and dropped them
again, softly, as if gently fanning&mdash;fanning a cool breath upon
someone. Broad, diagonal stripes of a gorgeous bright blue marked his
wings, his black head was covered as with dark velvet, his face was like
a strangely mysterious mask, out of which glowed a pair of dark eyes.
How wonderful were the creatures of the night! A&nbsp;little cold shiver
ran through Maya, who felt she was dreaming the strangest dream of her
life.</p>

<p>“You are beautiful,” she said to the moth, “beautiful, really.” She
was awed and solemn.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<p>“Who is your companion?” the moth asked the sprite.</p>

<p>“A bee. I met her just as I was leaving my flower.”</p>

<p>The moth seemed to realize what that meant. He looked at Maya almost
enviously.</p>

<p>“You fortunate creature!” he said in a low, serious, musing tone,
shaking his head to and fro.</p>

<p>“Are you sad?” asked Maya out of the warmth of her heart.</p>

<p>The moth shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, not sad.” His voice sounded friendly and grateful, and he gave
Maya such a kind look that she would have liked to strike up a
friendship with him then and there.</p>

<p>“Is the bat still abroad, or has he gone to rest?” This was the
question for which the sprite had stopped the moth.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone to rest long ago. You want to know, do you, on account
of your companion?”</p>

<p>The sprite nodded. Maya was dying to find out what a bat was, but the
sprite seemed to be in a hurry. With a charming gesture of
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
restlessness he tossed his shining hair back from his forehead.</p>

<p>“Come, Maya,” he said, “we must hurry. The night is so short.”</p>

<p>“Shall I carry you part of the way?” asked the moth.</p>

<p>The sprite thanked him but declined. “Some other time!” he
called.</p>

<p>“Then it will be never,” thought Maya as they flew away, “because at
dawn the flower-sprite must die.”</p>

<p>The moth remained on the leaf looking after them until the glimmer of
the fairy garments grew smaller and smaller and finally sank into the
depths of the blue distance. Then he turned his face slowly and surveyed
his great dark wings with their broad blue stripes. He sank into
revery.</p>

<p>“So often I have heard that I am gray and ugly,” he said to himself,
“and that my dress is not to be compared with the superb robes of the
butterfly. But the little bee saw only what is beautiful in
me.&mdash;And she asked me if I was sad. I&nbsp;wonder whether I am or
not.&mdash;No, I&nbsp;am not sad,” he decided, “not now.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<p>Meanwhile Maya and the flower-sprite flew through the dense shrubbery
of a garden. The glory of it in the dimmed moonlight was beyond the
power of mortal lips to say. An intoxicatingly sweet cool breath of dew
and slumbering flowers transformed all things into unutterable
blessings. The lilac grapes of the acacias sparkled in freshness, the
June rose-tree looked like a small blooming heaven hung with red lamps,
the white stars of the jasmine glowed palely, sadly, and poured out
their perfume as if, in this one hour, to make a gift of their all.</p>

<p>Maya was dazed. She pressed the sprite’s hand and looked at him.
A&nbsp;light of bliss shone from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Who could have dreamed of this!” whispered the little bee.</p>

<p>Just then she saw something that sent a pang through her.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, “look! A star has fallen! It’s straying about and
can’t find its way back to its place in the sky.”</p>

<p>“That’s a firefly,” said the flower-sprite, without a smile.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<p>Now, in the midst of her amazement, Maya realized for the first time
why the sprite seemed so dear and kind. He never laughed at her
ignorance; on the contrary, he helped her when she went wrong.</p>

<p>“They are odd little creatures,” the sprite continued. “They carry
their own light about with them on warm summer nights and enliven the
dark under the shrubbery where the moonlight doesn’t shine through. So
firefly can keep tryst with firefly even in the dark. Later, when we
come to the human beings, you will make the acquaintance of one of
them.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Maya.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached an arbor completely overgrown with
jasmine and woodbine. They descended almost to the ground. From close
by, within the arbor, came the sound of faint whispering. The
flower-sprite beckoned to a firefly.</p>

<p>“Would you be good enough,” he asked, “to give us a little light? We
have to push through these dark leaves here; we want to
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
get to the inside of the jasmine-arbor.”</p>

<p>“But your glow is much brighter than mine.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” put in Maya, more to hide her excitement than
anything else.</p>

<p>“I must wrap myself up in a leaf,” explained the sprite,<ins class =
"correction" title = "missing quotation mark"> “</ins>else the human
beings would see me and be frightened. We sprites appear to human beings
only in their dreams.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the firefly. “I am at your service. I will do what I
can.&mdash;Won’t the great beast with you hurt&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>The sprite shook his head no, and the firefly believed him.</p>

<p>The sprite now took a leaf and wrapped himself in it; the gleam of
his white garments was completely hidden. Then he picked a little
bluebell from the grass and put it on his shining head like a helmet.
The only bit of him left exposed was his face, which was so small that
surely no one would notice it. He asked the firefly to perch on his
shoulder and with its wing to dim its lamp on the one side so as to keep
the dazzle out of his eyes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<p>“Come now,” he said, taking Maya’s hand. “We had better climb up
right here.”</p>

<p>The little bee was thinking of something the sprite had said, and as
they clambered up the vine, she asked:</p>

<p>“Do human beings dream when they sleep?”</p>

<p>“Not only then. They dream sometimes even when they are awake. They
sit with their bodies a little limp, their heads bent a little forward,
and their eyes searching the distance, as if to see into the very
heavens. Their dreams are always lovelier than life. That’s why we
appear to them in their dreams.”</p>

<p>The sprite now laid his tiny finger on his lips, bent aside a small
blooming sprig of jasmine, and gently pushed Maya ahead.</p>

<p>“Look down,” he said softly, “you’ll see what you have been wishing
to see.”</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic162.png" width = "256" height = "192"
alt = "Maya and the sprite watching two humans">
</p>

<p>The little bee looked and saw two human beings sitting on a bench in
the shadows cast by the moonlight&mdash;a boy and a girl, the girl with
her head leaning on the boy’s shoulder, and the boy holding his arm
around the girl
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
as if to protect her. They sat in complete stillness, looking wide-eyed
into the night. It was as quiet as if they had both gone to sleep. Only
from a distance came the chirping of the crickets, and slowly, slowly
the moonlight drifted through the leaves.</p>

<p>Maya, transported out of herself, gazed into the girl’s face.
Although it looked pale and wistful, it seemed to be transfused by the
hidden radiance of a great happiness. Above her large eyes lay golden
hair, like the golden hair of the sprite, and upon it rested the
heavenly sheen of the midsummer night. From her red lips, slightly
parted, came a breath of rapture and melancholy, as if she wanted to
offer everything that was hers to the man by her side for his
happiness.</p>

<p>And now she turned to him, pulled his head down, and whispered a
magical something that brought a smile to his face such as Maya thought
no earthly being could wear. In his eyes gleamed a happiness and a vigor
as if the whole big world were his to own, and suffering and misfortune
were banished forever from the face of the earth.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<p>Maya somehow had no desire to know what he said to the girl in reply.
Her heart quivered as though the ecstasy that emanated from the two
human beings was also hers.</p>

<p>“Now I have seen the most glorious thing that my eyes will ever
behold,” she whispered to herself. “I know now that human beings are
most beautiful when they are in love.”</p>

<p>How long Maya stayed behind the leaves without stirring, lost in
looking at the boy and girl, she did not know. When she turned round,
the firefly’s lamp had been extinguished, the sprite was gone. Through
the doorway of the arbor far across the country on the distant horizon
showed a narrow streak of red.</p>

CHAPTER XII</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">ALOIS, LADYBIRD AND POET</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">The</span>
sun was risen high above the tops of the beech-trees when Maya awoke in
her woodland retreat. In the first moments, the moonlight, the chirping
of the cricket, the midsummer night meadow, the lovely sprite, the boy
and the girl in the arbor, all seemed the perishing fancies of a
delicious dream. Yet here it was almost midday; and she remembered
slipping back into her chamber in the chill of dawn. So it had all been
real, she <i>had</i> spent the night with the flower-sprite and
<i>had</i> seen the two human beings, with their arms round each other,
in the arbor of woodbine and jasmine.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<p>The sun outside was glowing hot on the leaves, a warm wind was
stirring, and Maya heard the mixed chorus of thousands of insects. Ah,
what these knew, and what <i>she</i> knew! So proud was she of the great
thing that had happened to her that she couldn’t get out to the others
fast enough; she thought they must read it in her very looks.</p>

<p>But in the sunlight everything was the same as ever. Nothing was
changed; nothing recalled the blue moonlit night. The insects came, said
how-do-you-do, and left; yonder, the meadow was a scene of bustling
activity; the insects, birds and butterflies hopped, flew and flitted in
the hot flickering air around the tall, gay midsummer flowers.</p>

<p>Sadness fell upon Maya. There was no one in the world to share her
joys and sorrows. She couldn’t make up her mind to fly over and join the
others in the meadow. No, she would go to the woods. The woods were
serious and solemn. They suited her mood.</p>

<p>How many mysteries and marvels lie hidden in the dim depths of the
woods, no one suspects who hurries unobservant along the
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
beaten tracks. You must bend aside the branches of the underbrush, or
lean down and peep between the blackberry briars through the tall
grasses and across the thick moss. Under the shaded leaves of the
plants, in holes in the ground and tree-trunks, in the decaying bark of
stumps, in the curl and twist of the roots that coil on the ground like
serpents, there is an active, multiform life by day and by night, full
of joys and dangers, struggles and sorrows and pleasures.</p>

<p>Maya divined only a little of this as she flew low between the
dark-brown trunks under the leafy roof of green. She followed a narrow
trail in the grass, which made a clear path through thicket and
clearing. Now and then the sun seemed to disappear behind clouds, so
deep was the shade under the high foliage and in the close shrubbery;
but soon she was flying again through a bright shimmer of gold and green
above the broad-leaved miniature forests of bracken and blackberry.</p>

<p>After a long stretch the woods opened their columned and over-arched
portals; before Maya’s eyes lay a wide field of grain in the
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
golden sunshine. Butterfly-weed flamed on the grassy borders. She
alighted on the branch of a birch-tree at the edge of the field and
gazed upon the sea of gold that spread out endlessly in the tranquillity
of the placid day. It rippled softly under the shy summer breeze, which
blew gently so as not to disturb the peace of the lovely world.</p>

<p>Under the birch-tree a few small brown butterflies, using the
butterfly-weed for corners, were playing puss-in-the-corner,
a&nbsp;favorite game with butterfly-children. Maya watched them a
while.</p>

<p>“It must be lots of fun,” she thought, “and the children in the hive
might be taught to play it, too. The cells would do for
corners.&mdash;But Cassandra, I&nbsp;suppose, wouldn’t permit it. She’s
so strict.”</p>

<p>Ah, now Maya felt sad again. Because she had thought of home. And she
was about to drift off into homesick revery when she heard someone
beside her say:</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic171.png" width = "252" height = "174"
alt = "Maya and Alois go different ways">
</p>

<p>“Good morning. You’re a beast, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>Maya turned with a start.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<p>“No,” she said, “decidedly not.”</p>

<p>There sitting on her leaf was a little polished terra-cotta
half-sphere with seven black dots on its cupola of a back, a&nbsp;minute
black head and bright little eyes. Peeping from under the dotted dome
and supporting it as best they could Maya detected thin legs fine as
threads. In spite of his queer figure, she somehow took a great liking
to the stout little fellow; he had distinct charm.</p>

<p>“May I ask who you are? I myself am Maya of the nation of bees.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insult me? You have no reason to.”</p>

<p>“But why should I? I don’t know you, really I don’t.” Maya was quite
upset.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to <i>say</i> you don’t know me.&mdash;Well, I’ll jog your
memory. Count.” And the little rotundity began to wheel round
slowly.</p>

<p>“You mean I’m to count your dots?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Seven,” said Maya.</p>

<p>“Well?&mdash;Well? You still don’t know. All right then, I’ll tell
you. I’m called exactly
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
according to what you counted. The scientific name of our family is
Septempunctata. <i>Septem</i> is Latin for seven, <i>punctata</i> is
Latin for dots, points, you see. Our common name is ladybird, my own
name is Alois, I&nbsp;am a poet by profession. You know our common name,
of course.”</p>

<p>Maya, afraid of hurting Alois’ feelings, didn’t dare to
say&nbsp;no.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he, “I live by the sunshine, by the peace of the day, and
by the love of mankind.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you eat, too?” asked Maya, quite astonished.</p>

<p>“Of course. Plant-lice. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No. That would be&mdash;that is....”</p>

<p>“Is what? Is what?”</p>

<p>“Not&mdash;usual,” said Maya shyly.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course!” cried Alois, trying to raise one shoulder,
but not succeeding, on account of the firm set of his dome. “As a
bourgeoise you would, of course, do only what is usual. We poets would
not get very far that way.&mdash;Have you time?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Maya.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<p>“Then I’ll recite you one of my poems. Sit real still and close your
eyes, so that nothing distracts your attention. The poem is called
<i>Man’s Finger</i>, and is about a personal experience. Are you
listening?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to every word.”</p>

<p>“Well, then:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“‘Since you did not do me wrong,</p>
<p class = "indent">That you found me, doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You are rounded, you are long;</p>
<p class = "indent">Up above you wear a flatter,</p>
<p class = "indent">Pointed, polished sheath or platter</p>
<p>Which you move as swift as light,</p>
<p>But below you’re fastened tight!’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Well?” asked Alois after a short pause. There were tears in his eyes
and a quaver in his voice.</p>

<p>“<i>Man’s Finger</i> gripped me very hard,” replied Maya in some
embarrassment. She really knew much lovelier poems.</p>

<p>“How do you find the form?” Alois questioned with a smile of fine
melancholy. He seemed to be overwhelmed by the effect he had
produced.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<p>“Long and round. You yourself said so in the poem.”</p>

<p>“I mean the artistic form, the form of my verse.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;oh, yes. Yes, I thought it was very good.”</p>

<p>“It is, isn’t it!” cried Alois. “What you mean to say is that
<i>Man’s Finger</i> may be ranked among the best poems you know of, and
one must go way back in literature before one comes across anything like
it. The prime requisite in art is that it should contain something new,
which is what most poets forget. And bigness, too. Don’t you agree
with&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Maya, “I think....”</p>

<p>“The firm belief you express in my importance as a poet really
overwhelms me. I&nbsp;thank you.&mdash;But I must be going now, for
solitude is the poet’s pride. Farewell.”</p>

<p>“Farewell,” echoed Maya, who really didn’t know just what the little
fellow had been after.</p>

<p>“Well,” she thought, “<i>he</i> knows. Perhaps he’s not full grown
yet; he certainly isn’t large.” She looked after him, as he hastened
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
up the branch. His wee legs were scarcely visible; he looked as though
he were moving on low rollers.</p>

<p>Maya turned her gaze away, back to the golden field of grain over
which the butterflies were playing. The field and the butterflies gave
her ever so much more pleasure than the poetry of Alois, ladybird and
poet.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">How</span>
happily the day had begun and how miserably it was to end!</p>

<p>Before the horror swept upon her, Maya had formed a very remarkable
acquaintance. It was in the afternoon near a big old water-butt. She was
sitting amid the scented elder blossoms, which lay mirrored in the
placid dark surface of the butt, and a robin redbreast was warbling
overhead, so sweetly and merrily that Maya thought it was a shame,
a&nbsp;crying shame that she, a&nbsp;bee, could not make friends with
the charming songsters. The trouble was, they were too big and ate
you&nbsp;up.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<p>She had hidden herself in the heart of the elder blossoms and was
listening and blinking under the pointed darts of the sunlight, when she
heard someone beside her sigh. Turning round she saw&mdash;well, now it
really <i>was</i> the strangest of all the strange creatures she had
ever met. It must have had at least a hundred legs along each side of
its body&mdash;so she thought at first glance. It was about three times
her size, and slim, low, and wingless.</p>

<p>“For goodness sake! Mercy on me!” Maya was quite startled. “You must
certainly be able to run!”</p>

<p>The stranger gave her a pondering look.</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” he said. “I doubt it. There’s room for improvement.
I&nbsp;have too many legs. You see, before all my legs can be set in
motion, too much time is lost. I&nbsp;didn’t use to realize this, and
often wished I had a few more legs. But God’s will be done.&mdash;Who
are you?”</p>

<p>Maya introduced herself. The other one nodded and moved some of his
legs.</p>

<p>“I am Thomas of the family of <ins class = "correction" title =
"spelling unchanged">millepeds</ins>. We are an old race, and we arouse
admiration and astonishment in all parts of the globe. No
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
other animals can boast anything like our number of legs. Eight is
<i>their</i> limit, so far as I know.”</p>

<p>“You are tremendously interesting. And your color is so queer. Have
you got a family?”</p>

<p>“Why, no! Why should I? What good would a family do me? We millepeds
crawl out of our eggs; that’s all. If <i>we</i> can’t stand on our own
feet, who should?”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” Maya observed thoughtfully. “But have you no
relations?”</p>

<p>“No, dear child. I earn my living, and doubt. I doubt.”</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>What</i> do you doubt?”</p>

<p>“I was born doubting. I must doubt.”</p>

<p>Maya stared at him in wide-eyed bewilderment. What did he mean, what
could he possibly mean? She couldn’t for the life of her make out, but
she did not want to pry too curiously into his private affairs.</p>

<p>“For one thing,” said Thomas after a pause, “for one thing I doubt
whether you have chosen a good place to rest in. Don’t you know what’s
over there in the big willow?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<p>“You see! I doubted right away if you knew. The city of the hornets
is over there.”</p>

<p>Maya turned deathly white and nearly fell off the elder blossoms. In
a voice shaking with fright, she asked just where the city was.</p>

<p>“Do you see that old nesting-box for starlings, there in the
shrubbery near the trunk of the willow-tree? It’s so poorly placed that
I doubted from the first whether starlings would ever move in. If a
bird-house isn’t set with its door facing the sunrise, every decent bird
will think twice before taking possession. Well, the hornets have
entrenched themselves in it. It’s the biggest hornets’ fortress in the
country. You as a bee certainly ought to know of the place. Why, the
hornets are brigands who lie in wait for you bees. So, at least,
I&nbsp;have observed.”</p>

<p>Maya scarcely heard what he was saying. There, showing clear against
the green, she saw the brown walls of the fortress. She almost stopped
breathing.</p>

<p>“I must fly away,” she cried.</p>

<p>Too late! Behind her sounded a loud, mean laugh. At the same moment
the little
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
bee felt herself caught by the neck, so violently that she thought her
joints were broken. It was a laugh she would never forget, like a vile
taunt out of hellish darkness. Mingling with it was another gruesome
sound, the awful clanking of armor.</p>

<p>Thomas let go with all his legs at once and tumbled head over heels
through the branches into the water-butt.</p>

<p>“I doubt if you get away alive,” he called back. But the poor little
bee no longer heard.</p>

<p>She couldn’t see her assailant, her neck was caught in too firm a
grip, but a gilt-sheathed arm passed before her eyes, and a huge head
with dreadful pincers suddenly thrust itself above her face. She took it
at first to belong to a gigantic wasp, but then realized that she had
fallen into the clutches of a hornet. The black-and-yellow striped
monster was surely four times her size.</p>

<p>Maya lost sight, hearing, speech; every nerve in her body went faint.
At length her voice came back, and she screamed for help.</p>

<p>“Never mind, girlie,” said the hornet in a honey-sweet tone that was
sickening. “Never
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
mind. It’ll last until it’s over.” He smiled a baleful smile.</p>

<p>“Let go!” cried Maya. “Let me go! Or I’ll sting you in your
heart.”</p>

<p>“In my heart right away? Very brave. But there’s time for that
later.”</p>

<p>Maya went into a fury. Summoning all her strength, she twisted
herself around, uttered her shrill battle-cry, and directed her sting
against the middle of the hornet’s breast. To her amazement and horror,
the sting, instead of piercing his breast, swerved on the surface. The
brigand’s armor was impervious.</p>

<p>Wrath gleamed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I could bite your head off, little one, to punish you for your
impudence. And I would, too, I&nbsp;would indeed, but for our queen. She
prefers fresh bees to dead carcasses. So a good soldier saves a juicy
morsel like you to bring to her alive.”</p>

<p>The hornet, with Maya still in his grip, rose into the air and made
directly for the fortress.</p>

<p>“This is too awful,” thought the poor little bee. “No one can stand
this.” She fainted.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic181.png" width = "262" height = "205"
alt = "Maya in the hornet prison">
</p>

<p>When she came to her senses, she found herself
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
in half darkness, in a sultry dusk permeated by a horrid, pungent smell.
Slowly everything came back to her. A&nbsp;great paralyzing sadness
settled in her heart. She wanted to cry: the tears refused to come.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been eaten up yet, but I may be, any moment,” she thought
in a tremble.</p>

<p>Through the walls of her prison she caught the distinct sound of
voices, and soon she noticed that a little light filtered through a
narrow chink. The hornets make their walls, not of wax like the bees,
but of a dry mass resembling porous grey paper. By the one thread of
light she managed bit by bit to make out her surroundings. Horror of
horrors! Maya was almost congealed with fright: the floor was strewn
with the bodies of dead insects. At her very feet lay a little
rose-beetle turned over on its back; to one side was the skeleton of a
large locust broken in two, and everywhere were the remains of
slaughtered bees, their wings and legs and sheaths.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, to think this had to happen to me,” whimpered little Maya.
She did not dare to stir the fraction of an inch and pressed herself
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
shivering into the farthest corner of this chamber of horrors.</p>

<p>Again she heard voices on the other side of the wall. Impelled by
mortal fear, she crept up to the chink and peeped through. What she saw
was a vast hall crowded with hornets and magnificently illuminated by a
number of captive glow-worms. Enthroned in their midst sat the queen,
who seemed to be holding an important council. Maya caught every word
that was said.</p>

<p>If those glittering monsters had not inspired her with such
unspeakable horror, she would have gone into raptures over their
strength and magnificence. It was the first time she had had a good view
of any of the race of brigands. Tigers they looked like, superb tigers
of the insect world, with their tawny black-barred bodies. A&nbsp;shiver
of awe ran through the little bee.</p>

<p>A sergeant-at-arms went about the walls of the hall ordering the
glow-worms to give all the light they could; they must strain themselves
to the utmost. He muttered his commands in a low voice, so as not to
interrupt
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
the deliberations, and thrust at them with a long spear, hissing as he
did&nbsp;so:</p>

<p>“Light up, or I’ll eat you!”</p>

<p>Terrible the things that were done in the fortress of the
hornets!</p>

<p>Then Maya heard the queen say:</p>

<p>“Very well, we shall abide by the arrangements we have made.
To-morrow, one hour before dawn, the warriors will assemble and sally
forth to the attack on the city of the bees in the castle park. The hive
is to be plundered and as many prisoners taken as possible. He who
captures Queen Helen VIII and brings her to me alive will be dubbed a
knight. Go forth and be brave and victorious and bring back rich
booty.&mdash;The meeting is herewith adjourned. Sleep well, my warriors.
I&nbsp;bid you good-night.”</p>

<p>The queen-hornet rose from her throne and left the hall accompanied
by her body-guard.</p>

<p>Maya nearly cried out loud.</p>

<p>“My country!” she sobbed, “my bees, my dear, dear bees!” She pressed
her hands to her mouth to keep herself from screaming. She was in the
depths of despair. “Oh, would
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
that I had died before I heard this. No one will warn my people. They
will be attacked in their sleep and massacred. O&nbsp;God, perform a
miracle, help me, help me and my people. Our need is great!”</p>

<p>In the hall the glow-worms were put out and devoured. Gradually the
fortress was wrapped in a hush. Maya seemed to have been forgotten.
A&nbsp;faint twilight crept into her cell, and she thought she caught
the strumming of the crickets’ night song outside.&mdash;Was anything
more horrible than this dungeon with its carcasses strewn on the
ground!</p>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE SENTINEL</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Soon,</span>
however, the little bee’s despair yielded to a definite resolve. It was
as though she once more called to mind that she was a bee.</p>

<p>“Here I am weeping and wailing,” she thought, “as if I had no brains
and as if I were a weakling. Oh, I’m not much of an honor to my people
and my queen. They are in danger. I&nbsp;am doomed anyhow. So since
death is certain one way or another, I&nbsp;may as well be proud and
brave and do everything I can to try to save them.”</p>

<p>It was as though Maya had completely forgotten the long time that had
passed since she
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
left her home. More strongly than ever she felt herself one of her
people; and the great responsibility that suddenly devolved upon her,
through the knowledge of the hornets’ plot, filled her with fine courage
and determination.</p>

<p>“If my people are to be vanquished and killed, I want to be killed,
too. But first I must do everything in my power to save them.”</p>

<p>“Long live my queen!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Quiet in there!” clanged harshly from the outside.</p>

<p>Ugh, what an awful voice!&mdash;The watchman making his
rounds.&mdash;Then it was already late in the night.</p>

<p>As soon as the watchman’s footsteps had died away, Maya began to
widen the chink through which she had peeped into the hall. It was easy
to bite away the brittle stuff of the partition, though it took some
time before the opening was large enough to admit her body. At length,
in the full knowledge that discovery would cost her her life, she
squeezed through into the hall. From remote depths
<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
of the fortress echoed the sound of loud snoring.</p>

<p>The hall lay in a subdued blue light that found its way in through
the distant entrance.</p>

<p>“The moonlight!” Maya said to herself. She began to creep cautiously
toward the exit, cowering close in the deep shadows of the walls, until
she reached the high, narrow passageway that led from the hall to the
opening through which the light shone. She heaved a deep sigh. Far, far
away glimmered a star.</p>

<p>“Liberty!” she thought.</p>

<p>The passageway was quite bright. Softly, stepping oh so very softly,
Maya crept on. The portal came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>“If I fly now,” she thought, “I’ll be out in one dash.” Her heart
pounded as if ready to burst.</p>

<p>But there in the shadow of the doorway stood a sentinel leaning
against a column.</p>

<p>Maya stood still, rooted to the spot. Vanished all her hopes. Gone
the chance of escape. There was no getting by that formidable
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
figure. What was she to do? Best go back where she had come from. But
the sight of the giant in the doorway held her in a spell. He seemed to
be lost in revery. He stood gazing out upon the moon-washed landscape,
his head tilted slightly forward, his chin propped on his hand. How his
golden cuirass gleamed in the moonlight! Something in the way he stood
there stirred the little bee’s emotions.</p>

<p>“He looks so sad,” she thought. “How handsome he is, how superbly he
holds himself, how proudly his armor shines! He never removes it,
neither by day nor by night. He is always ready to rob and fight and
die....”</p>

<p>Little Maya quite forgot that this man was her enemy. Ah, how often
the same thing had happened to her&mdash;that the goodness of her heart
and her delight in beauty made her lose all sense of danger.</p>

<p>A golden dart of light shot from the bandit’s helmet. He must have
turned his head.</p>

<p>“My God,” whispered Maya, “this is the end of me!”</p>

<p>But the sentinel said quietly:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<p>“Just come here, child.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Maya. “You saw me?”</p>

<p>“All the time, child. You bit a hole through the wall, then you crept
along&mdash;crept along&mdash;tucking yourself very neatly into the dark
places&mdash;until you reached the spot where you’re standing. Then you
saw me, and you lost heart. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Maya, “quite right.” Her whole body shook with terror.
The sentinel, then, had seen her the entire time. She remembered having
heard how keen were the senses of these clever freebooters.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he asked good-humoredly.</p>

<p>Maya still thought he looked sad. His mind seemed to be far away and
not to concern itself with what was of such moment to her.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get out,” she answered. “And I’m not afraid. I&nbsp;was
just startled. You looked so strong and handsome, and your armor shone
so. Now I’ll fight you.”</p>

<p>The sentinel, slightly astonished, leaned forward, and looked at Maya
and smiled. It
<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
was not an ugly smile, and Maya experienced an entirely new feeling: the
young warrior’s smile seemed to exercise a mysterious power over her
heart.</p>

<p>“No, little one,” he said almost tenderly, “you and I won’t fight.
You bees belong to a powerful nation, but man for man we hornets are
stronger. To do single battle with a bee would be beneath our dignity.
If you like you may stay here a little while and chat. But only a little
while. Soon I’ll have to wake the soldiers up; then, back to your cell
you must&nbsp;go.”</p>

<p>How curious! The hornet’s lofty friendliness disarmed Maya more than
anger or hate could have done. The feeling with which he inspired her
was almost admiration. With great sad eyes she looked up at her enemy,
and constrained, as always, to follow the impulses of her heart, she
said:</p>

<p>“I have always heard bad things about hornets. But you are not bad.
I&nbsp;can’t believe you’re bad.”</p>

<p>The warrior looked at Maya.</p>

<p>“There are good people and bad people
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
everywhere,” he said, gravely. “But you mustn’t forget we are your
enemies, and shall always remain your enemies.”</p>

<p>“Must an enemy always be bad?” asked Maya. “Before, when you were
looking out into the moonlight, I&nbsp;forgot that you were hard and
dangerous. You seemed sad, and I have always thought that people who
were sad couldn’t possibly be wicked.”</p>

<p>The sentinel said nothing, and Maya continued more boldly:</p>

<p>“You are powerful. If you want to, you can put me back in my cell,
and I’ll have to die. But you can also set me free&mdash;if you
want&nbsp;to.”</p>

<p>At this the warrior drew himself up. His armor clanked, and the arm
he raised shone in the moonlight.</p>

<p>But the moonlight was turning dimmer in the passageway. Was dawn
coming already?</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said. “I can. My people and my queen have
entrusted me with this power. My orders are that no bee who has
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
set foot in this fortress shall leave it alive. I&nbsp;shall keep faith
with my people.”</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic193.png" width = "287" height = "260"
alt = "Maya talks to the hornet sentinel">
</p>

<p>After a pause he added softly as if to himself: “I have learned by
bitter experience how faithlessness can hurt&mdash;when Loveydear
forsook&nbsp;me....”</p>

<p>Little Maya was overcome. She did not know what to say. Ah, the same
sentiments moved her, too&mdash;love of her own kind, loyalty to her
people. Nothing to be done here but to use force or strategy. Each did
his duty, and yet each remained an enemy to the other.</p>

<p>But hadn’t the sentinel mentioned a name? Hadn’t he said something
about someone’s having been unfaithful to him? Loveydear&mdash;why, she
knew Loveydear&mdash;the beautiful dragon-fly who lived at the lakeside
among the waterlilies.</p>

<p>Maya quivered with excitement. Here, perhaps, was her salvation. But
she wasn’t quite sure how much good her knowledge would be to her. So
she said prudently:</p>

<p>“Who is Loveydear, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, little one. She’s not your affair,
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
and she’s lost to me forever. I&nbsp;shall never find her again.”</p>

<p>“I know Miss Loveydear.” Maya forced herself to put the utmost
indifference into her tone. “She belongs to the family of dragon-flies
and she’s the loveliest lady of all.”</p>

<p>A tremendous change came over the warrior. He seemed to have
forgotten where he was. He leapt over to Maya’s sides as if blown by a
violent gust.</p>

<p>“What! You know Loveydear? Tell me where she is. Tell me, right
away.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Maya spoke quietly and firmly; she glowed with secret delight.</p>

<p>“I’ll bite your head off if you don’t tell.” The warrior drew
dangerously close.</p>

<p>“It will be bitten off anyhow. Go ahead. I shan’t betray the lovely
dragon-fly. She’s a close friend of mine.... You want to imprison
her.”</p>

<p>The warrior breathed hard. In the gathering dawn Maya could see that
his forehead
<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
was pale and his eyes tragic with the inner struggle he was waging.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he said wildly. “It’s time to rouse the
soldiers.&mdash;No, no, little bee, I&nbsp;don’t want to harm Loveydear.
I&nbsp;love her, more dearly than my life. Tell me where I shall find
her again.”</p>

<p>Maya was clever. She purposely hesitated before she said:</p>

<p>“But I love my life.”</p>

<p>“If you tell me where Loveydear lives”&mdash;Maya could see that the
sentinel spoke with difficulty and was trembling all over<ins class =
"correction" title = "open quote missing">&mdash;“</ins>I’ll set you
free. You can fly wherever you want.”</p>

<p>“Will you keep your word?”</p>

<p>“My word of honor as a brigand,” said the sentinel proudly.</p>

<p>Maya could scarcely speak. But, if she was to be in time to warn her
people of the attack, every moment counted. Her heart exulted.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, “I believe you. Listen, then. Do you know the
ancient linden-trees near the castle? Beyond them lies one meadow after
another, and finally comes a big
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
lake. In a cove at the south end where the brook empties into the lake
the waterlilies lie spread out on the water in the sunlight. Near them,
in the rushes, is where Loveydear lives. You’ll find her there every day
at noon when the sun is high in the heavens.”</p>

<p>The warrior had pressed both hands to his pale brow. He seemed to be
having a desperate struggle with himself.</p>

<p>“You’re telling the truth,” he said softly and groaned, whether from
joy or pain it was impossible to tell. “She told me she wanted to go
where there were floating white flowers. Those must be the flowers you
speak of. Fly away, then. I&nbsp;thank you.”</p>

<p>And actually he stepped aside from the entrance.</p>

<p>Day was breaking.</p>

<p>“A brigand keeps his word,” he said.</p>

<p>Not knowing that Maya had overheard the deliberations in the council
chamber, he told himself that one small bee more or less made little
difference. Weren’t there hundreds of others?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
<p>“Good-by,” cried Maya, breathless with haste, and flew off without a
word of thanks.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, there was no time to spare.</p>

CHAPTER XV</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE WARNING</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Little</span>
Maya summoned every bit of strength and will power she had left. Like a
bullet shot from the muzzle of a gun (bees can fly faster than most
insects), she darted through the purpling dawn in a lightning beeline
for the woods, where she knew she would be safe for the moment and could
hide herself away should the hornet regret having let her go and follow
in pursuit.</p>

<p>Gossamer veils hung everywhere over the level country, big drops fell
from the trees on the dry leaves carpeting the ground, and the cold in
the woods threatened to paralyze little Maya’s wings. No ray of the dawn
had as
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
yet found its way between the trees. The air was as hushed as if the sun
had forgotten the earth, and all creatures had laid themselves to
eternal rest.</p>

<p>Maya, therefore, flew high up in the air. Only one thing
mattered&mdash;to get back as quickly as strength and wits permitted to
her hive, her people, her endangered home. She must warn her people.
They must prepare against the attack which the terrible brigands had
planned for that very morning. Oh, if only the nation of bees had the
chance to arm and make ready its defenses, it was well able to cope with
its stronger opponents. But a surprise assault at rising time! What if
the queen and the soldiers were still asleep? The success of the hornets
would then be assured. They would take prisoners and give no quarter.
The butchery would be horrible.</p>

<p>Thinking of the strength and energy of her people, their readiness to
meet death, their devotion to their queen, the little bee felt a great
wrath against their enemies the hornets. Her beloved people! No
sacrifice was too great for them. Little Maya’s heart swelled with
<span class = "pagenum">196</span>
the ecstasy of self-sacrifice and the dauntless courage of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It was not easy for her to find her way over the woods. Long before
she had ceased to observe landmarks as did the other bees, who had great
distances to come back with their loads of nectar. She felt she had
never flown as high before, the cold hurt, and she could scarcely
distinguish the objects below.</p>

<p>“What can I go by?” she thought. “No one thing stands out.
I&nbsp;shan’t be able to reach my people and help them. Oh, oh! And here
I had a chance to atone for my desertion. What shall I do? What shall I
do?”&mdash;Suddenly some secret force steered her in a certain
direction. “<i>What</i> is pushing and pulling me? It must be
homesickness guiding me back to my country.” She gave herself up to the
instinct and flew swiftly on. Soon, in the distance, looking like grey
domes in the dim light of the dawn, showed the mighty lindens of the
castle park. She exclaimed with delight. She knew where she was. She
dropped closer to the earth. In the meadows on one side hung the
luminous wisps of fog, thicker here than in the
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
woods. She thought of the flower-sprites who cheerfully died their early
death inside the floating veils. That inspired her anew with confidence.
Her anxiety disappeared. Let her people spurn her from the kingdom, let
the queen punish her for desertion, if only the bees were spared this
dreadful calamity of the hornets’ invasion.</p>

<p>Close to the long stone wall shone the silver-fir that shielded the
bee-city against the west wind. And there&mdash;she could see them
distinctly now&mdash;were the red, blue, and green portals of her
homeland. The stormy pounding of her heart nearly robbed her of her
breath. But on she flew toward the red entrance which led to her people
and her queen.</p>

<p>On the flying-board, two sentinels blocked the entrance and laid
hands upon her. Maya was too breathless to utter a syllable, and the
sentinels threatened to kill her. For a bee to force its way into a
strange city without the queen’s consent is a capital offense.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” cried one sentinel, thrusting her roughly away. “What’s
the matter with you! If you don’t leave this instant, you’ll
die.&mdash;Did
<span class = "pagenum">198</span>
you ever!” He turned to the other sentinel. “Have you ever seen the
like, and before daytime too?”</p>

<p>Now Maya pronounced the password by which all the bees knew one
another. The sentinels instantly released her.</p>

<p>“What!” they cried. “You are one of us, and we don’t know you?”</p>

<p>“Let me get to the queen,” groaned the little bee. “Right away,
quick! We are in terrible danger.”</p>

<p>The sentinels still hesitated. They couldn’t grasp the situation.</p>

<p>“The queen may not be awakened before sunrise,” said the one.</p>

<p>“Then,” Maya screamed, her voice rising to a passionate yell such as
the sentinels had probably never heard from a bee before, “then the
queen will never wake up alive. Death is following at my heels. Take me
to the queen! Take me to the queen, I&nbsp;say!” Her voice was so wild
and wrathful that the sentinels were frightened, and obeyed.</p>

<p>The three hurried together through the warm, well-known streets and
corridors.
<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
Maya recognized everything, and for all her excitement and the
tremendous need for haste, her heart quivered with sweet melancholy at
the sight of the dear familiar scenes.</p>

<p>“I am at home,” she stammered with pale lips.</p>

<p>In the queen’s reception room she almost broke down. One of the
sentinels supported her while the other hurried with the unusual message
into the private chambers. Both of them now realized that something
momentous was taking place, and the messenger ran as fast as his legs
would carry him.</p>

<p>The first wax-generators were already up. Here and there a little
head thrust itself out curiously from the openings. The news of the
incident traveled quickly.</p>

<p>Two officers emerged from the private chambers. Maya recognized them
instantly. In solemn silence, without a word to her, they took their
posts, one on each side of the doorway: the queen would soon appear.</p>

<p>She came without her court, attended only by her aide and two
ladies-in-waiting. She hurried straight over to Maya. When she
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
saw what a state the child was in, the severe expression on her face
relaxed a little.</p>

The Queen came without her court, attended only by her aide and two
ladies-in-waiting</p>

<p>“You have come with an important message? Who are you?”</p>

<p>Maya could not speak at once. Finally she managed to frame two
words:</p>

<p>“The hornets!”</p>

<p>The queen turned pale. But her composure was unshaken, and Maya was
somewhat calmed.</p>

<p>“Almighty queen!” she cried. “Forgive me for not respecting the
duties I owe Your Majesty. Later I will tell you everything I have done.
I&nbsp;repent. With my whole heart I repent.&mdash;Just a little while
ago, as by a miracle, I&nbsp;escaped from the fortress of the hornets,
and the last I heard was that they were planning to attack and plunder
our kingdom at dawn.”</p>

<p>The wild dismay that the little bee’s words produced was
indescribable. The ladies-in-waiting set up a loud wail, the officers at
the door turned pale and made as if to dash off and sound the alarm, the
aide said: “Good God!” and wheeled completely round, because he wanted
to see on all sides at once.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<p>As for the queen, it was really extraordinary to see with what
composure, what resourcefulness she received the dreadful news. She drew
herself up, and there was something in her attitude that both
intimidated and inspired endless confidence. Little Maya was awed.
Never, she felt, had she witnessed anything so superior. It was like a
great, magnificent event in itself.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

</p>

<p>The queen beckoned the officers to her side and uttered a few rapid
sentences aloud. At the end Maya heard:</p>

<p>“I give you one minute for the execution of my orders. A fraction of
a second longer, and it will cost you your heads.”</p>

<p>But the officers scarcely looked as if they needed this incentive. In
less time than it takes to tell they were gone. Their instant readiness
was a joy to behold.</p>

<p>“O my queen!” said Maya.</p>

<p>The queen inclined her head to the little bee, who once again for a
brief moment saw her monarch’s countenance beam upon her gently,
lovingly.</p>

<p>“You have our thanks,” she said. “You have
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
saved us. No matter what your previous conduct may have been, you have
made up for it a thousandfold.&mdash;But go, rest now, little girl, you
look very miserable, and your hands are trembling.”</p>

<p>“I should like to die for you,” Maya stammered, quivering.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about us,” replied the queen. “Among the thousands
inhabiting this city there is not one who would hesitate a moment to
sacrifice his life for me and for the welfare of the country. You can go
to sleep peacefully.”</p>

<p>She bent over and kissed the little bee on her forehead. Then she
beckoned to the ladies-in-waiting and bade them see to Maya’s rest and
comfort.</p>

<p>Maya, stirred to the depths of her being, allowed herself to be led
away. After this, life had nothing lovelier to offer. As in a dream she
heard the loud, clear signals in the distance, saw the high dignitaries
of state assemble around the royal chambers, heard a dull, far-echoing
drone that shook the hive from roof to foundation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<p>“The soldiers! Our soldiers!” whispered the ladies-in-waiting at her
side.</p>

<p>The last thing Maya heard in the little room where her companions put
her to bed was the tramp of soldiers marching past her door and commands
shouted in a blithe, resolute, ringing voice. Into her dreams, echoing
as from a great distance, she carried the ancient song of the
soldier-bees:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>Sunlight, sunlight, golden sheen,</p>
<p class = "indent">By your glow our lives are lighted;</p>
<p>Bless our labors, bless our Queen,</p>

CHAPTER XVI</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE BATTLE</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">The</span>
kingdom of the bees was in a whirl of excitement. Not even in the days
of the revolution had the turmoil been so great. The hive rumbled and
roared. Every bee was fired by a holy wrath, a&nbsp;burning ardor to
meet and fight the ancient enemy to the very last gasp. Yet there was no
disorder or confusion. Marvelous the speed with which the regiments were
mobilized, marvelous the way each soldier knew his duty and fell into
his right place and took up his right work.</p>

<p>It was high time. At the queen’s call for volunteers to defend the
entrance, a&nbsp;number
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
of bees offered themselves, and of these several had been sent out to
see if the enemy was approaching. Two had now returned&mdash;whizzing
dots&mdash;and reported that the hornets were drawing near.</p>

<p>An awesome hush of expectancy fell upon the hive. Soldiers in three
closed ranks stood lined up at the entrance, proud, pale, solemn,
composed. No one spoke. The silence of death prevailed, except for the
low commands of the officers drawing up the reserves in the rear. The
hive seemed to be fast asleep. The only stir came from the doorway where
about a dozen wax-generators were at work in feverish silence <ins class
= "correction" title = "text reads ‘excuting’">executing</ins> their
orders to narrow the entrance with wax. As by a miracle, two thick
partitions of wax had already gone up, which even the strongest hornets
could not batter down without great loss of time. The hole had been
reduced by almost half.</p>

<p>The queen took up an elevated position inside the hive from which she
was able to survey the battle. Her aides flew scurrying hither and
thither.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<p>The third messenger returned. He sank down exhausted at the queen’s
feet.</p>

<p>“I am the last who will return,” he shouted with all the strength he
had left. “The others have been killed.”</p>

<p>“Where are the hornets?” asked the queen.</p>

<p>“At the lindens!&mdash;Listen, listen,” he stammered in mortal
terror, “the air hums with the wings of the giants.”</p>

<p>No sound was heard. It must have been the poor fellow’s terrified
imagination, he must have thought he was still being pursued.</p>

<p>“How many are there?” asked the queen sternly. “Answer in a low
voice.”</p>

<p>“I counted forty.”</p>

<p>Although the queen was startled by the enemy’s numbers, she gave no
sign of shock.</p>

<p>In a ringing, confident voice that all could hear, she said:</p>

<p>“Not one of them will see his home again.”</p>

<p>Her words, which seemed to sound the enemy’s doom, had instant
effect. Men and officers alike felt their courage rise.</p>

<p>But when in the quiet of the morning an ominous whirring was heard
outside the hive,
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
first softly, then louder and louder, and the entrance darkened, and the
whispering voices of the hornets, the most frightful robbers and
murderers in the insect world, penetrated into the hive, then the faces
of the valiant little bees turned pale as if washed over by a drab light
falling upon their ranks. They gazed at one another with eyes in which
death sat waiting, and those who were ranged at the entrance knew full
well that one moment more and all would be over with them.</p>

<p>The queen’s controlled voice came clear and tranquil from her place
on high:</p>

<p>“Let the robbers enter one by one until I give orders to attack. Then
those at the front throw themselves upon the invaders a hundred at a
time, and the ranks behind cover the entrance. In that way we shall
divide up the enemy’s forces. Remember, you at the front, upon your
strength and endurance and bravery depends the fate of the whole state.
Have no fear; in the dusk the enemy will not see right away how well
prepared we are, and he will enter unsuspecting....”</p>

<p>She broke off. There, thrust through the
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
doorway, was the head of the first brigand. The feelers played about,
groping, cautious, the pincers opened and closed. It was a
blood-curdling sight. Slowly the huge black-and-gold striped body with
its strong wings crept in after the head. The light falling in from the
outside drew gleams from the warrior’s cuirass.</p>

<p>Something like a quiver went through the ranks of the bees, but the
silence remained unbroken.</p>

<p>The hornet withdrew quietly. Outside he could be heard
announcing:</p>

<p>“They’re fast asleep. But the entrance is half walled up and there
are no sentinels. I&nbsp;do not know whether to take this as a good or a
bad sign.”</p>

<p>“A good sign!” rang out. “Forward!”</p>

<p>At that two giants leapt in through the entrance side by side; after
them, soundlessly, pressed a throng of striped, armed, gleaming
warriors, awful to behold. Eight made their way into the hive. Still no
orders to attack from the queen. Was she dumb with horror, had her voice
failed her?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
<p>And the brigands, did they not see in the shadow, to right and left,
the soldiers drawn up in close, glittering ranks ready for mortal
combat...?</p>

<p>Now at last came the order from on high:</p>

<p>“In the name of eternal right, in the name of your queen, to the
defense of the realm!”</p>

<p>At that a droning roar went up. Never before had the city been shaken
by such a battle-cry. It threatened to burst the hive in two. Where, an
instant before, the hornets had been visible singly, there were now
buzzing heaps, thick, dark, rolling knots. A&nbsp;young officer had
scarcely awaited the end of the queen’s words. He wanted to be the first
to attack. He was the first to die. He had stood for some time ready to
leap all a-quiver with eagerness for battle, and at the first sound of
the order he rushed forward right into the clutches of the foremost
brigand. His delicately fine-pointed sting found its way between the
head and upper breast-ring of his opponent; he heard the hornet give a
yell of rage, saw him double up into a glittering, gold-black ball. Then
the bandit’s fearful sting leapt out and pierced
<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
between the young officer’s breast-rings right into his heart; and dying
the bee felt himself and his mortally wounded enemy sink under a cloud
of storming bees. His brave death inspired them all with the wild
rapture that comes from utter willingness to die for a noble cause.
Fearful was their attack upon the invaders. The hornets were sore
pressed.</p>

<p>But the hornets are an old race of robbers, trained to warfare.
Pillage and murder have long been their gruesome profession. Though the
initial assault of the bees had confused and divided them, yet the
damage was not so great as might have seemed at first. For the bees’
stings did not penetrate their breastplates, and their strength and
gigantic size gave them an advantage of which they were well aware.
Their sharp, buzzing battle-cry rose high above the battle-cry of the
bees. It is a sound that fills all creatures with horror, even human
beings, who dread this danger signal, and are careful not to enter into
conflict with hornets unprotected.</p>

<p>Those of the assailants who had already penetrated into the hive
quickly realized that
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
they must make their way still deeper inward if they were not to block
up the entrance to their comrades outside. And so the struggling knots
rolled farther and farther down the dark streets and corridors. How
right the queen had been in her tactics! No sooner was a bit of space at
the entrance cleared than the ranks in the rear leapt forward to its
defense. It was an old strategy, and a dreadful one for the enemy. When
a hornet at the entrance gave signs of exhaustion, the bees shammed the
same, and let him crawl in; but the instant the one behind showed his
head a great swarm of fresh soldiers dashed up to defend the apparently
unprotected entrance, while the invader who had gone on ahead would find
himself, already wearied, suddenly confronted by glittering ranks of
soldier-bees who had not yet stirred a finger in battle. Generally he
succumbed to their superior numbers at the very first attack.</p>

<p>Now the groans of the wounded and the shrieks of the dying mingled in
wild agony with the fierce battle-cries. The hornets’ stings worked
fearful havoc among the bees.
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
The rolling knots left tracks of dead bodies in their wake. The hornets,
whose retreat had been cut off, realizing that they would never see the
light of day again, fought the fight of despair. Yet, slowly, one by
one, they succumbed. There was one great thing against them. Though
their strength was inexhaustible, not so the poison of their sting.
After a time their sting lost its virulence, and the wounded bees,
knowing they’d recover, fought in the consciousness of certain victory.
To this was added the grief of the bees for their dead; it gave them the
power of divine wrath.</p>

<p>Gradually the din subsided. The loud calls of the hornets on the
outside met with no response from the invaders within.</p>

<p>“They are all dead,” said the leader of the hornets grimly, and
summoned the combatants back from the entrance. Their numbers had melted
down to half.</p>

<p>“We have been betrayed,” said the leader. “The bees were
prepared.”</p>

<p>The hornets were assembled on the silver-fir. It had grown lighter,
and the red of dawn
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
tinged the tops of the linden-trees. The birds began to sing. The dew
fell. Pale and quivering with rage of battle, the warriors stood around
their leader, who was waging an awful inward struggle. Should he yield
to prudence or to his lust for pillage? The former prevailed. There was
no use anyway. His whole tribe was in danger of destruction. Grudgingly,
in a shudder of thwarted ambition, he determined to send a messenger to
the bees to sue for the return of the prisoners.</p>

<p>He chose his cleverest officer and called upon him by name.</p>

<p>A depressed silence instead of an answer. The officer was among those
who had been cut off.</p>

<p>The leader, overcome now by mortal dread lest those who had entered
would never return, quickly chose another officer. The raging and
roaring in the beehive could be heard in the distance.</p>

<p>“Be quick!” he cried, laying the white petal of a jasmine in the
messenger’s hand, “or the human beings will soon come and we shall be
lost. Tell the bees we will go away and leave
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
them in peace forever if they will deliver up the prisoners.”</p>

<p>The messenger rushed off. At the entrance he waved his white signal
and alighted on the flying-board.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic217.png" width = "243" height = "194"
alt = "the hive entrance">
</p>

<p>The queen-bee was immediately informed that an emissary was outside
who wanted to make terms, and she sent her aide to parley with him. When
he returned with his report she sent back this reply:</p>

<p>“We will deliver up the dead if you want to take them away. There are
no prisoners. All of your people who invaded our territory are dead.
Your promise never to return we do not believe. You may come again,
whenever you wish. You will fare no better than you did to-day. And if
you want to go on with the battle we are ready to fight to the last
bee.”</p>

<p>The leader of the hornets turned pale when this message was delivered
to him. He clenched his fists, he fought with himself. Only too gladly
would he have yielded to the wishes of his warriors who clamored for
revenge. Reason prevailed.</p>

<p>“We <i>will</i> come again,” he hissed. “How
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
could this thing have happened to us? Are we not a more powerful people
than the bees? Every campaign of mine so far has been successful and has
only added to our glory. How can I face the queen after this defeat?” In
a quiver of fury he cried again: “How could this thing have happened to
us? There must be treachery somewhere.”</p>

<p>An older hornet known as a friend of the queen’s here took up the
word.</p>

<p>“It is true, we <i>are</i> a more powerful race, but the bees are a
unified nation, and unflinchingly loyal to their people and their state.
That is a great source of strength; it makes them irresistible. Not one
of them would turn traitor; each without thought of self serves the weal
of all.”</p>

<p>The leader scarcely listened.</p>

<p>“My day is coming,” he hissed. “What care I for the wisdom of these
bourgeois! I&nbsp;am a brigand and will die a brigand.&mdash;But to keep
up the battle now would be madness. What good would it do us if we
destroyed the whole hive, and none of us came back alive?” Turning to
the messenger, he cried:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<p>“Give us back our dead. We will withdraw.”</p>

<p>A dead silence fell. The messenger flew off.</p>

<p>“We must be prepared for a fresh piece of trickery, though I don’t
think the hornets are in a fighting mood at present,” said the queen bee
when she heard the hornets’ decision. She gave orders for the
rear-guard, wax-generators, and honey-carriers to remove the dead from
the city while two fresh regiments guarded the entrance.</p>

<p>Her orders were carried out. Over mountains of the dead one brigand’s
body after another was dragged to the entrance and thrown to the ground
outside.</p>

<p>In gloomy silence the troop of hornets waited on the silver-fir and
saw the corpses of their fallen warriors drop one by one to the
earth.</p>

<p>The sun arose upon a scene of endless desolation. Twenty-one slain,
who had died a glorious death, made a heap in the grass under the city
of the bees. Not a drop of honey, not a single prisoner had been taken
by the enemy.
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
The hornets picked up their dead and flew away, the battle was over, the
bees had conquered.</p>

<p>But at what a cost! Everywhere lay fallen bodies, in the streets and
corridors, in the dim places before the brooders and honey-cupboards.
Sad was the work in the hive on that lovely morning of summer sunshine
and scented blossoms. The dead had to be disposed of, the wounded had to
be bandaged and nursed. But before the hour of noon had struck, the
regular tasks were begun; for the bees neither celebrated their victory
nor spent time mourning their dead. Each bee carried his pride and his
grief locked quietly in his breast and went about his work.</p>

CHAPTER XVII</a></h5>

<h5 class = "chaptitle">THE QUEEN’S FRIEND</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">The</span>
noise of battle awoke Maya out of a brief sleep. She jumped up and
straightway wanted to dash out to help defend the city, but soon
realized that she was too weak to be of any help.</p>

<p>A group of struggling combatants came rolling toward her. One of them
was a strong young hornet, an officer, Maya judged by his badge, who was
defending himself unaided against an overwhelming number of bees. The
struggling knot drew nearer. To Maya’s horror it left one dead bee after
another in its wake. But numbers finally told against the giant: whole
clusters of bees, ready to die
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
rather than let go, hung to his arms and legs and feelers, and their
stings were beginning to pierce between the rings of his breast. Maya
saw him drop down exhausted. Without cry or complaint, fighting to the
very end, neither suing for mercy nor reviling his opponents, he went
down to his brigand’s death.</p>

<p>The bees left him and hurried back to the entrance to throw
themselves anew into the conflict.</p>

<p>Maya’s heart was beating stormily. She slipped over to the hornet. He
lay curled up in the twilight, still breathing. She counted about twenty
stings, most of them in the fore part of his body, leaving his golden
armor quite whole and sound. Seeing he was still alive, she hurried away
to bring water and honey&mdash;to cheer the dying man, she thought. But
he shook his head and waived her off with his hand.</p>

<p>“I <i>take</i> what I want,” he said proudly. “I don’t care for
gifts.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Maya, “I only thought you might be thirsty.”</p>

<p>The young officer smiled at her, then said, not sadly, but with a
strange earnestness:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
<p>“I must die.”</p>

<p>The little bee could not reply. For the first time in her life she
seemed to comprehend what it meant to have to die; and death seemed much
closer when someone else was about to die than when her own life had
been imperiled in the spider’s web.</p>

<p>“If there were only <i>some</i>thing I could do,” she said, and burst
into tears.</p>

<p>The dying hornet made no answer. He opened his eyes once again and
heaved a deep breath&mdash;for the last time. Half an hour later he was
thrown down into the grass outside the hive along with his dead
comrades.</p>

<p>Little Maya never forgot what she had learned from this brief
farewell. She knew now for all time that her enemies were beings like
herself, loving life as she did and having to die a hard death without
succor. She thought of the flower sprite who had told her of his rebirth
when Nature sent forth her blossoms again in the spring; and she longed
to know whether the other creatures would, like the sprite, come back to
the light of life after they had died the death of the earth.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
<p>“I will believe it is so,” she said softly.</p>

<p>A messenger now came and summoned her to the queen’s presence. She
found the full court assembled in the royal reception room. Her legs
shook, she scarcely dared to raise her eyes before her monarch and so
many dignitaries. A&nbsp;number of the officers of the queen’s staff
were missing, and the gathering was unusually solemn. Yet a gleam of
exaltation seemed to light every brow&mdash;as if the consciousness of
triumph and new glory won encircled everyone like an invisible halo.</p>

<p>The queen arose, made her way unattended through the assemblage, went
up to little Maya and took her in her arms.</p>

<p>This Maya had never expected, not this. The measure of her joy was
full to overflowing; she broke down and wept.</p>

<p>The bees were deeply stirred. There was not one among them who did
not share Maya’s happiness, who was not deeply grateful for the little
bee’s valiant deed.</p>

<p>Maya now had to tell her whole story. Everybody wanted to know how
she had learned of the hornets’ plans and how she had
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
succeeded in breaking out of the awful prison from which no bee had ever
before escaped.</p>

<p>So Maya told of all the remarkable things she had seen and heard, of
Miss Loveydear with the glittering wings, of the grasshopper, of Thekla
the spider, of Puck, and of how splendidly Bobbie had come to her
rescue. When she told of the sprite and the human beings, it was so
quiet in the hall that you could hear the generators in the back of the
hive kneading the wax.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the queen, “who’d have thought the sprites were so
lovely?” She smiled to herself with a look of melancholy and longing, as
people will who long for beauty.</p>

<p>And all the dignitaries smiled the same smile.</p>

<p>“How did the song of the sprite go?” she asked. “Say it again. I’d
like to learn it by heart.”</p>

<p>Maya repeated the song of the sprite.</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>My soul is that which breathes anew</p>
<p>From all of loveliness and grace;</p>
<p>And as it flows from God’s own face,</p>
<p>It flows from his creations, too.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<p>There was silence for a while. The only sound was a restrained
sobbing in the back of the hall&mdash;probably someone thinking of a
friend who had been killed.</p>

<p>Maya went on with her story. When she came to the hornets, the bees’
eyes darkened and widened. Each imagined himself in the situation in
which one of their number had been, and quivered, and drew a deep
breath.</p>

<p>“Awful,” said the queen, “perfectly awful....”</p>

<p>The dignitaries murmured something to the same effect.</p>

<p>“And so,” Maya ended, “I reached home. And I sue for your Majesty’s
pardon&mdash;a thousand times.”</p>

<p>Oh, no one bore the little bee any ill will for having run away from
the hive. You may imagine they did not.</p>

<p>The queen put her arm round Maya’s neck.</p>

<p>“You did not forget your home and your people,” she said kindly. “In
your heart you were loyal. So we will be loyal to you. Henceforth you
shall stay by my side and help me conduct the affairs of state. In that
way,
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
I think, your experiences, all the things you have learned, will be made
to serve the greatest good of your people and your country.”</p>

<p>Cheers of approval greeted the queen’s words.</p>

<p>So ends the story of the adventures of Maya the bee. They say her
work contributed greatly to the good and welfare of the nation, and she
came to be highly respected and loved by her people. Sometimes on quiet
evenings she went for a brief hour’s conversation to Cassandra’s
peaceful little room, where the ancient dame lived now on pension honey.
There Maya told the young bees, who listened to her eagerly, stories of
the adventures which we have lived through with her.</p>
